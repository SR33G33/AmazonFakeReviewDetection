just to be fair, i really believe that this is a great slicer , and the idea was there, but unfortunately there are tricks when using this spiral slicer, i mean manual or something would have been helpful.<br /><br />I'm not saying something negative about this slicer because it does work, but however it did it took me almost a week in trying to learn how to use this slicer in cutting different kinds of vegetable.<br />the price i may say is fair, but i do wish that there were manuals in every box in showing us how to use this slicer properly.

My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/wa7AI ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano: it is one of the most powerful healing herbs and natural anti-biotics ever studied. It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!! I also have used oregano as emergency medicine to completely eliminate digestive distress after eating what I found out was contaminated food.

This mask is great for the purpose of keeping out the light for sure! My hubs gets up at 4am to go work and he is a butthead by turning on all the lights. Since getting this, Ive havent had any issues sleeping through it! lol. It looks like a mini bra because its not like your traditional flat sleep masks that lay flat over your eyes. This one has little &#34;cups&#34; that doesnt touch your eyelids at all which is nice because with my old sleep mask it made me itchy. The only reason why I didnt give this 5 stars is because whenever I turned to sleep on my sides it kinda made it uncomfortable to sleep with it on. I had to sleep on my back to make it stay on. For me I hate sleeping on my back so :(

Studies have reported lowering of LDL and triglycerides while increasing HDL. A clinical study on patients who have suffered a heart attack found that a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, reduced the risk of repeat heart attacks by 45 revascularization (bypass surgery/angioplasty), cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality by one-third; and cancer mortality by two-thirds.<br /><br />A recent study has found that nattokinase combined with red yeast rice can significantly lower cholesterol. I use it with Best Nattokinase( goo.gl/32EeB ) and this does a fabulous job of reducing my LDL and overall cholesterol( from 220 to 150 ). Amazing!

Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a "fat burner" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)

I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to starttaking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help.

This company sent me a email after i purchased this on eBay and asked me to review the product on amazon.  They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks. I searched online about this and diybypass is really a no-name company so go figure.

My 19 month old loves these videos, especially the shapes DVD for some reason. She can say circle and star now, and recognizes some others when she plays with her [[ASIN:B0089W1IGG Baby's First Blocks]]. She can also count from one to five, and names a few letters here and there.<br /><br />I give the videos credit that they hold her attention and she has learned a lot from them. They are slow paced and not too flashy like most cartoons on TV. The animations are colorful and the music is decent.<br /><br />However, they get boring for adults to watch. The videos repeat the word over and over again, which gets tiring for me to listen to. In all fairness the repetition definitely helps her to learn faster so I guess I should just deal with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* The videos work well.<br />* My daughter loves them.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring for adults to watch.

I love it. It fits really well in the driver's seat. I'm not used to driving long distances that's why I ordered this one for back support. I tried it first on my computer chair and it really feels comfortable. I like the material of the cover made too. It's soft and very nice material. I tried it on the driver's seat as well and it's perfect. It helps me relaxed my back don't need to actually pull the driver's seat forward. I think I made a great decision in buying this Lumbar cushion. The only thing that I'm worried is the durability of this cushion. I think it's good if you don't use it too much because I feel like it's not hard enough not to sag after couple years. I hope I'm wrong. But you know what, it's perfect for the present and for probably the coming whole year.

We changed from swaddlers to cruisers when our baby started to crawl excessively. The diapers moved with her better and gave a lot better coverage. Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: [[ASIN:B00BMIT1U4 All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste Diaper Rash Ointment + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion]]. It absorbs well so it's not left all messy and residue on the diaper when you put a fresh one on. Anything still there at the next change wipes right off her bottom with ease too.

There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.

I purchased Herbalife a few months ago at my local health retailer and had high hopes for this with the numerous good reviews I read. Although, after using it for 6 weeks fairly regularly, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Normally people keep eating unhealthy or don't stay active during the use of these kinds of products, but I didn't do that at all. I honestly didn't lose more than 2 pounds at any time during the use of this product. It was hard to comprehend that even after that much regular use, I wasn't losing weight.<br /><br />After realizing this, I decided to try something new. After consulting with friends and family, I went with a product that has been nothing short of AMAZING. I have lost 23 pounds in the last 7 weeks and I have never felt better. This is only the start! I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long to find something that worked for me.<br /><br />If you want to actually lose weight, take a look at this item here on Amazon and give it a chance ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1jSaoQQ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the product for you, I'm at least glad I could share my experience about this product and how it did not work for me.

Yes, the effect is slow. However, that should prove that It's actually working. This helps to promote the regrowth of hair; new hair follicles don't grow overnight.  I have been unable to grow back my eyebrows after an accident a few years ago. I purchased this balm, and It's like a miracle for me. My eyebrows are finally starting to grow back, evenly and nicely. If you want a fast acting balm that doesn't have the real effect, don't buy this. If you want something that will take some time but bring long term results, this is the best balm on the market.

I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.

I do a lot of running, and have recently began having some minor joint discomfort in my left knee and hip as a result of training for a marathon. After speaking with my Dr about the pain, he said that I should look at Glucosamine supplements to see if they could help. So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more &#34;smooth&#34; feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running. It is a bit more expensive than I would like which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I have to admit it has really helped me out.

Overall I have more of the following since using the cosaminDS capsules;<br />flexibility<br />desire to be mobile<br />ability to stand for prolonged periods of time<br /><br />All of which are majorly important in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. For a long time I began to let those things slip away because I was constantly in pain and aching. Adding a natural supplement to nurture my problems has been a huge relief.<br /><br />Even more effective than the cosaminDS by itself has been combining it with higher levels of glucosamine, chondroitin, and cissus powder: [[ASIN:B009ZP5ERA Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM Blend w/ White Willow Bark 750 mg (60 Capsules) + FREE Cissus Joint Powder 100 Grams]]. The blend of those supplements has alleviated all my major aches and complaints as well as made me less stiff after sleep or sitting for prolonged periods of time. I can make it up my front steps without growling in pain.

It is a Multi Function color laser printer, scanner and dual sided printing/scanning. If you do not need this last option there are printers about HALF the size and weight. I'd go for it but my parents sometimes need the dual sided function.<br /><br />Well, it's a good printer for Office use. Do not even think on printing resolution pics on it, it does not output well, specially with other kinds of papers.<br /><br />Be also aware of the &#34;dial&#34; that keeps warning you to change toners when you don't need. Just look on youtube for videos on how to reset the toner counter on the side dial.

I have been using these for about 2 months and they worked pretty well, but not quite what I was expecting. I definitely saw some improvement though. I switched over to Phytoderm, [[ASIN:B00IT4POOG PhytoDermTM- The Best 100% Pure Skin Restoring Anti-Aging Phytoceramides, 350mg! Clinically Proven! Facelift in a Bottle - As seen on Dr. Oz!

I am not sure what the difference is, but its worth the extra couple bucks for the 20-30% improvement. Both good products, but the phytoderm is certainly the better of the two.

The headset has worked great in my household. I have left them on my head and realized they were working clear as a bell downstairs when I retrieved something to drink. What clarity they have! Tune them in and you're all set. I've even laid down with them and they don't turn off like others have. All the controls are on the side of the ear piece and don't get in the way of lying on side. What a great deal!

The reason so many reviewers have been disappointed with this product is not because of the quality.  Any tribulus product that contains 45% Saponins, is simply not going to compare to a tribulus that contains a high concentration of Protodioscin (the main ingredient responsible for the benefits I gets when taking tribulus).  The most potent form of tribulus is extracted at a ratio of 90%, [[ASIN:B007RLZDBQ Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder 50 Grams]].  Even than I would still recommend combining it with some longjack or DAA, if increasing testosterone levels is your main motivation for taking it in the first place.

I have to say, with all of the junky MacBook battery replacements out there, I had my hopes quite low when I decided to buy this instead of buying an OEM replacement one. After a good deal of research and review reading I finally made my mind and bought this Key Power's battery and to be honest, so far it has been great. It gave me about 3 hours of unplugged power after 1st charge and cycle, and has actually improved in the 2 weeks since I got it. I'm not sure how long it will last, but the 18 month warranty makes me feel comfortable. I'm glad that I took.

Pros:<br />-maintains the standard Zippo design and distinctive "click" sound when opened.<br />-very compact design, fits really nicely in my hand and pocket for easy carry.<br />-black matte finish is quite gorgeous. I wanted something different from the typical chrome finish and am not disappointed! The black finish also holds up well to use and handling.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-since the lighter is so small, you may find that the usage varies quite a lot from when it is full to empty on fuel. The flame can vary in height and intensity. Also, I notice the smell of unburned lighter fluid quite frequently. Refueling often becomes necessary.

I am still learning the art of getting these molds filled correctly, but am starting to have a bit more success. I used the ice for the first time this week and I was a little bit non-plussed by the length of time they lasted. I was using the ice inside, in a controlled-temperature environment and I can't say that I noticed they lasted any longer than say, a cube from an actual ice cube tray. However ... I still think they are worth it because the look much cooler than a cube! I am eager to try using filtered water to see if I can get crystal clear ice balls. The ball is about the size of a golf ball. I would like it to be a bit bigger (I am starting to giggle as I write this) so you could plop one in a rocks glass instead of two. However, this size also fits in tall, slim glasses. They're fun! If you're serving drinks or just enjoy a good sip of Scotch, you should have these.

The counter stool is great for the price, and the fact that it is available immediately is a big plus. Most stores we went to required a few weeks to prepare. The wood has a nice smooth polish to it, the stands are very stable, and they look great in our kitchen. However there is one drawback that I have noticed. After only 2 months of use, the cushion has started to basically wear out thin. Not noticeable from the outside, but when you sit on it, you can feel the nails and wooden frame underneath. Not really comfortable after say 10-15 minutes.

This chair is quite durable. I bought it for my daughter's room and she is happy with it. The seat and back are very fluffy and comfortable. The only thing I'm not happy about, is the color. I bought the blue since my daughter's bedroom walls are painted a very light blue, like the color shown online for this chair. If the chair color actually looked like the one in the online photo, it would be perfect. But it is a much darker blue than it is shown and I was very disappointed with that...

I recently began a new fitness program that put a pounding on my 55 year old joints. I was so sore that it was discouraging me from working out. I wanted to continue making great progress toward my goal but without the joint pain. I did some research and read several reviews about Glucosamine Chondroitin and MSM. I decided to try Kirkland brand and it worked pretty well. Pain subsided a bit but my joints were still achy, but a definite improvement. These tablets are also really big and difficult to swallow. I found another supplement called Flexadrene that contains Glucosamine, Chondriotin and MSM along with over 20 other ingredients that relieve joint pain [[ASIN:B00NOG20ZK Flexadrene – Complete Joint Care Formula]]I have been taking these for a month and my joint pain is all but gone and my workout regimen is even more intense. Plus, the Flexadrene pills are much easier to swallow. Overall, this is a good product, but if you don't mind spending a few extra dollars, I suggest trying Flexadrene.

It's a super convenient way to keep the teething toys with you at all times without worrying about them falling on the floor or getting thrown if you're out shopping etc.<br /><br />What makes this particular piece unique is that from a distance, you'd think it was actually jewelry. It's safe but it's multifaceted obviously so that makes it great for moms like me. Unless you're right on top of me you really can't tell it's beat up at all. It's great to know there's something I don't have to be embarrassed about if I forget to set it aside (we've all been there- puke on shirts...you know ladies) before we go out later or something along those lines.

The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />"Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me..."<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series.

This is my second Brita pitcher. The second time around I decided to go big and it is working out ok. The problem with this company is that they seem incapable of producing a lid that fits correctly. You have to hold it in place when pouring (it doesn't fit snugly; one end always sticks up). Same thing occurred with first one I owned. And yes, they were that way right out of the package. Quality control is sorely lacking at Brita. But for the price, the filter does its job so it's an acceptable product and I will keep it.

I use the Pro-A Serum every other day. I apply  about a dime sized amount to my face and neck after completely washing and drying my face. It has no smell at all. It is a thicker serum, almost gel like. It absorbs well into my face and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I love the results I am getting from the Pro-A serum. My skin is tighter and more firm. It feels softer and more moisturized then it has in a long time. My lines and wrinkles are going away, and I just feel younger, knowing that my face looks better.

I had high hopes when I saw that this one was of the bestselling solar panels here. I read most of the reviews here, and decided to purchase one for my house. Once they arrived, I managed to install them and for the first day I didn't had any problem - only thing was that I noticed that panels were of low quality and fragile. Second day the charge controller broke for no apparent reason, I just saw it broken and since I couldn't fix it myself -I called support - which, by the way, was not helpful. I returned the panels and asked for a refund, because they didn't wrote in the description how fragile these were :/.<br /><br />I listened to my friend's advice, who's a solar repairman, and I bought, like he did, a Suntastic Charger ( http://amzn.to/1Ad27Vf ) which I received 4 days ago. It's strange how I never experienced any problem with these - the material was good and firm - and charger was much more practical than of the Renogy.

I wouldn't recommend this baby seat to anyone who wants a safety to his kid. Once I got it, I put it into my car, because I had to drive my kid to the kindergarten, and once I arrived, the buckle just stuck - for no apparent reason. After a 3 minute fight I managed to free my kid from a seat and it was a disappointing experience. It happened 4-5 times after, so in the end I called support and asked them for help. They didn't had concrete solution, so I returned the item and got a refund.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I bought 65LX Seat ( http://amzn.to/1xthVzA ), because a colleague who had a 6 yr old kid said he bought it too and never had any problem with it. Once I got it - a week ago - I never had any problems with buckles, and since it had positive reviews here I wondered why I didn't purchase it prior to this one.

I am a massage therapist and I use almond oil at my job on a daily basis. The oil really helps soothe the skin, especially when you're working with clients who are exposed to the elements a lot. I find it provides the client with a better experience overall, especially working on their backs. My ultimate forumla is to use almond oil on fair areas and jojoba oil on the rougher areas like hands, elbows, or feet. Jojoba oil is awesome- [[ASIN:B00AJFV8L6 NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz. + FREE Desert Essence Pure Jojoba Oil -- 4 fl oz]]. It really helps soften the skin in those extra hard places.<br /><br />I use the stuff at home too. One dab of each oil in the morning give my hands a soft feeling throughout the day whether I'm working or not. It's great on faces and for some clients, they've told me they use it in their hair as well. The stuff is great, non-greasy, and quick to use!

Within few minutes of applying this on my face my whole face broke out I mean major break out & my face turned all red and hot it's been a week now and I can still see patches of red dry skin on my face and forehead. I am absolutely positive that this is not pure argan oil , it is either mixed with sunflower oil or cut with other cheap mineral oils, I have never had this bad experience before with pure argan oil and I have been using argan oil for 2+ years now, the only time my skin would have a reaction or break out is if anything had either sesame oil or coconut oil in it or when the products contained mineral oils. We also noticed that this oil very thin compared to other expensive brands and my husband is researching this product and is trying to find a local lab so we can send this bottle to be tested to see what all stuff this oil contains.

Why have these customers only reviewed Viva Labs products, or sometimes nothing else. It's a little bit weird when you start to look at it.

The author of "Hell" seems to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book.<br /><br />In "How to Stop Believing in Hell" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list.

I personally chose the f4 version of this range because it's cheaper and it's and L lens which means the optics used are way more better and you can achieve crispier photos.<br /><br />I have a Canon Eos 7d., which is a good body for this range because given the 1.6x crop of it's sensor the equivalent range of this lens is 112-320mm 2.8. It's a perfect lens for bird photography and candid photos.<br /><br />The aperture for me is not an issue because you can still produce a BOKEH when in f4.. not much but its okay.. I also tried the 70-200 f2.8 and it's way more better. It's a good telephoto lens for the price..

I am a Keurig fanatic. The K-cups are a staple of my house. I find it very convenient especially in the morning because I am notorious for running late. K-cups make it really easy to measure and be on the run. Green tea is my favorite flavor and bigelow is amongst my favorite brand. I find these cups to be flavorful and not dull like so many alternatives. I also appreciate that it's not sweetened to death like some green teas.<br /><br />There are always those mornings where a little extra flavor can't hurt. Adding a dash of green tea powder {[[ASIN:B009PICJTS All Natural Organic Instant Green Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]} gives me the extra hit I'm looking for as well as a jolt of natural energy. I much prefer tea to coffee or other stimulants. Plus I don't have any crash which is always important.

It's been a week since I ordered RC Helicopter for my kid. (to be fair, I also love these things :)), and once I received it, I showed it to my kid and he was excited and told me that he wants to see it when it flies. So I got a joystick and saw that it doesn't receives any signal from helicopter. Firstly, I thought that it's because of batteries, logically, but the batteries were in, so I was confused. I told Amazon what I got and they said that I return the item and choose new one, because this one was out of stock :((.<br /><br />I choose another Helicopter which was far more better, It's Mini Radio RC Helicopter (http://amzn.to/12NArYx) which is cool and which worked from the first time I bought it :). In the end, my kid was happy to see it on air, so I was also :)).

These pills are pretty good but for now I can only give them a 3 star rating.<br /><br />I'm almost through with the first bottle I have and the weight loss has been coming and going even though I've been taking the recommended dosage. In my first week I managed to drop 5 pounds and I was very excited because I thought I'd found my miracle pill. The week after that I actually gained 3 of those pounds back even though I was doing the exact same routine. The third week I've managed to lose 4 more pounds from where I was in week 2. It's hard to say if I'm going to get consistent results from these at this point. I'm going to go ahead and finish off the bottle and possibly try another one. For now I'm giving it 3/5 because it's clearly working and helping me lose weight, I just can't figure out why it fluctuates so damn much.

These sheets are very soft and silky. I have washed these a few times and no shrinkage at all, which is what I wanted. The cotton sheets I have been buying will shrink after a few washings making it difficult to put the fitted sheet on the bed. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because they do not breathe like cotton and we have found them a little warm to sleep in. Other than that they are very nice sheets.

The packaging on this product could be much better.. The box was delivered to our home, and it was very..... Loose. The pieces inside were definitely not as secure as you would like. So there was one piece that has a tiny scratch on it. And I'm only mentioning it because it's on the outside in the center of the crib. But other than that, the instructions were great, and it was very easy to put together. I did it by myself, couldn't wait till my husband got home.

This is something that never happend with any TV that I bought - on Amazon or local store - and it just happend after a month of use. After I bought TV the picture was a little blur than it was described, but I could live with it. The problem started 10 days before the end of the month when picture faded out, every day, to black. Now all I see is a black picture with a sound? This doesn't has any sense, I contacted support and they were mesmerized, so I returned the item.<br /><br />I bought a similar TV by Samsung (http://amzn.to/1Bb6nSa), and the picture was good. However I never received an answer about what happened with previous TV, but it was something fishy :/, I guess it was malfunctioned...maybe.

Maybe I am skinny enough already, but the main thing I noticed about this is that it does slip a little. Not much, not enough to be even really concerned. It is a very effective product.    That said, I do like using this. It creates a lot of heat and perspiration. That has meant some loss of weight already, although I wonder if this is simply water, rather than the fat we are promised. Will return after more time and report my final findings. All in all, a recommended product, just make sure to use properly.

Had this product for about three weeks now and have lost eleven pounds, not too bad I guess. The DVDs are fun and high quality but I think my results would be better if I followed the nutrition plan that comes with the product. So I'm giving this 4 stars and will update to 5 if my results continue even without nutrition (I don't like changing what I eat). In any case, so far I've lost a good amount of weight and my stomach definitely looks better.<br /><br />P.S. For the one reviewer who didn't like some of the other reviews here. I bought this product on the baladea website and reviewed it since I always review my purchases here. It's not very nice to call people dishonest without any evidence. I recommend you try the product and write a comment based on that.

I am a bit thin side and 5 foot 3 inches which is a little bit shorter than the average girl. That being said, I feel like this one size fits all thing is not working, every time I keep finding myself pulling up the waist since it likes to sag down a bit. It has become very annoying since short skinny girls will not be able to do any good exercise like they want to. Forget about running, you will find yourself like one of those saggy pants guys that have no belts. The texture is okay but not great, surely not for the price. In the mean time I will be looking at other better designed leggings

I was just on  the Internet a few weeks ago and heard complaints about these chinese water ionizers.  These are the Aqua Ionizer by Air, Water and Life that are supposed to be made in the USA but are really made in China.  I bought my unit about 8 months ago and we used it for a while but really didn't notice any difference in our health.  We are active people in our late 40's and we are always looking for ways to make us healthy.  We have read a lot about what to look for an this company, Real Spirit, put on the Internet that the machine was top of the line at a low price.  We bought it based on this information and after trying it we stopped using it because of the lack of results.  A friend of my  Wife's was over the other day and when we were talking, this subject came up.  He showed us a bunch of negative stuff online and we realized we fell for this scam.  He also showed us some other company's products and said they were certified by a USA water quality company and there were several companies like this that guaranteed their products.  Watch out for this company Air, Water and Life and boycott them.

No more cellulite would be amazing, but I'd just settle for a reduction in the appearance of cellulite! NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentration is a potent product that helps to improve circulation, firm and tighten skin, and detoxify the area applied to.

I love the scent of this product and how refreshing it felt on my skin. I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and can tell that this product is working on tightening and firming my skin. While I still have my cellulite (and know nothing will actually cause it to disappear completely), I can tell that this product does do a little at helping to reduce it or the appearance of it. I also love that this product hasn't caused me any odd reactions and only pleased my senses and skin!

Loved Ender's game. Probably one of the best book's I've read. So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective.

This does not work with T-Mobile 4G! I purchased this based on the item description, which says that it works with all major cell phone companies in the US, with some listed exceptions. T-Mobile is a major cell phone company, and its network is not one of the exceptions listed. I installed it in my attic, powered it up, then spent a LONG time trying to figure out why it had no effect at all on my phone's reception. Turns out T-Mobile 4G is on a different bandwidth, though you have no way of knowing that from the description of the product on Amazon's site. (T-Mobile's 2G does work with this product.) I purchased from ANTOnline (there are different sellers for this product, depending on when you happen to buy). ANTOnline refused to give me a return RMA until Amazon intervened, and even then they took out a 15% restocking fee, which was just theft. In the process of figuring out how this technology works I talked to T-Mobile, and they sent me a free booster that actually works with their 4G network. Having tried both (Wilson's on the 2G, TMobile's on 4G) I have to conclude that Wilson's technology is falling behind: T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install. Wilson's requires a cable between the two, and took hours to install.

I purchased this Air Conditioner last month as a bed room air conditioner. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is it's such a pain to have it fit correctly in the window. The instructions are unhelpful and do not explain anything. When I did get it to sit correctly, I noticed it would not even keep a small bedroom cool on only 80 degree days. I tried everything I possibly could but didn't get any sort of result I was looking for.<br /><br />After talking to friends and family, I finally found an air conditioner that works AMAZING!!! I have never slept better in my life now that the weather has been heating up this past month and can't wait to sleep in a cool room all summer long!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY air conditioner, check this one out here on Amazon -----&#62; http://amzn.to/1hsKRDg<br /><br />It's not as cheap but is well worth the extra money, as it cools quickly and efficiently.

This gerber multitool is a great toy for me! My wife purchased this for a Christmas gift, and I don't think I've been this excited over something so simple! The sheath is very well designed, with a "rubber" loop that can be attached/re-attached without taking your belt off. My preference is to put it on the Shoulder strap of my camelback (it's my new fishing buddy) for easy access. I've used every aspect of this multi tool, and it's worked great for repairing a crab pot, for taking fish hooks out of their toothy mouths, and even cutting wire. I've used the saw to cut smaller pieces of wood, have used the screw drivers, can opener, botle opener, knife and scissors without any challenges.<br /><br />The flashlight (neatly and firmly attached to the sheath) is what you would expect from a one AAA light...not long life but if used as a true back up light or for limited bursts, it will last a few months. The firesteel is awesome, as long as you have time to play with it and figure out which technique works best for you. I've started a couple of fires with it now, and through trial and error, I've learned to scrape the black finish off the steel with the file, "rough" the steel surface up with the file edge (it really helps to create better spark), and to vary pressure, speed and angle of striker to maximize the sparks.<br /><br />Once that was all figured out, it's become kind of a magic trick! I've been asked why not just use a lighter. Well, I can, but it's not nearly as much fun, and not rewarding at all!<br /><br />Pricy? perhaps... but to me, it's already paid for itself and then some!

The package arrived on time, and the Pulse was very easy to install. It allows you to train the remote to control other devices (I added my Element TV and my DirecTV cable box/DVR). The Pulse  is small and easy to hide near your TV. I attached the Pulse to the back of TV screen. The remote is nice. It has a touch pad and QWERTY boards. It looks OK but feels great. If Pulse can put touch pad and keyboard at the same side, it will be better.<br /><br />Now I have Netflix, YouTube, Chrome, Crackle, Pandora, NYtimes, Flixster, Snagfilm.<br />There is a App spotlight, it includes a lot of apps. Most of them are linked to website. But I enjoy it since they are free and I can enjoy them on my LG TV connected via HDMI cable.I can show my picasa pictures on my big screen with Photo App. It includes picasa and Flickr since I setup picasa account only.Chrome works great with touchpad remote but it is not easier than my computer. I have to flip remote all the time.<br /><br />I have smart tv features on my old big TV with just one hundred dollars. So happy with my decision and I love my Pulse.

These work perfectly for that.The only issue is : The voice quality for answering phone calls is not outstanding. In fact, the quality seems barley adequate. Thankfully I use this headset mostly for podcast and for streamed TV and movies so I am very happy so far. Battery life is good I.

I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased Slim Fast after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on Slim Fast and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.<br /><br />If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----> http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.

Triple A batteries to run it.  Over time that would get expensive if I had not of gone to dollar tree, even then it will still rack up eventually, would be great if it was a mixture of crank and battery power, so when you are tired just use the batteries.

Don't bother buying this cutting machine, because you'll end up with wasting a good money on something that cannot be repaired. Once I got the package, I wanted to install the machine via internet updates, and after I connected (hardly) online I download the latest software, but the problem was not in that. The problem was that, in every 20 minutes, machine goes off for no apparent reason. The worst thing is that the Silhouette repair center DOESN'T EXIST. so no one could repair this machine. I ended up as returning this item to Amazon...<br /><br />Once I got a refund, I bought Cricut Explore ( http://amzn.to/13Njs94 ) cutting machine which was far more better than Silhoutte version. I didn't had any problems in installing it and the fact that it comes with battery that last for 2-3 hours is really something that beats Silhouette version :).

the food that comes out of this grill is so delicious, most of the time we use on weekends in the backyard and all the family gets united, that's what it is for. we cook, chicken, basically all types of meats. one of the best thing about the grill is that the smoke doesn't get so spread around like others because it has the cover on top, and it doesn't let so much smoke come out.<br /><br />one disadvantage and i personally think is one of the most important, the weight, it weight a lot and it is because of all the things that come included in it, like the slide burner and the holders on the side, but most definitely is one of the best grills in the stores, and market.<br /><br />the grill works with gas of course, which is good because the grills that work with carbon, make too much mess, is as if you had a stove in your own backyard or whatever place you'll use it.<br /><br />the little wheel on the bottom allows you to move it from any place to anywhere very easily.

I had high hopes when I ordered this set of binoculars. I recently read reviews and saw mostly positive ones, so I decided to get one for myself. Once I got them I noticed a hard focus - I couldn't set a proper distance, one which would be proper for my eyesight and binoculars. The more troubling problem was that there was some scratch inside the optics, so every object around me looked fuzzy. This was really a hard disappointing experience for me, so I asked for a refund.<br /><br />However I bought a Bushnell Binoculars (http://amzn.to/13xDW5q), because of a friendly suggestion. There were more practical and the fact that they are waterproof really changed my ways of using binoculars :).

Several reviewers compensate for the top of the filter being dry by rotating it 180º each time they fill the jug.  This wouldn't be necessary IF there was a pump that pumped water from the tank to the TOP of the filter.<br /><br />2.

These work pretty good. When I was doing my photo shoot last week, I decided to use these instead of my Opteka reflectors.  And guess what?  They work about the same, except the Neewer reflectors are a whole lot cheaper.  And the way they direct the light on my models when I'm shooting is wonderful.  I was taken by the first photo, and I expect to be using these for a long time.  The only thing I hate is fooling with the zipper on the tote bag.  It's not faulty; you just have to take your time to line the zipper up and it will work every time.  So, if you want professional quality reflectors at an affordable price, these are it.

I am not really reviewing this product entirely for its quality. Every quality has a price that it can justify. And this set of 3 styluses at like $2 is just what you get. A cheap quality product which does its job, well most of the time at least. Had I paid a slightly higher amount, rating would have been lower. Don't expect a long-lasting or high quality stylus here. I use it only sparingly so I'm quite fine with the quality.

When I first purchased this product, I was under the assumption it would be a great teething toy for my 6 month old girl.  The toy had a variety of shapes and contrasting colors sure to keep my child occupied for a while.  After a few weeks of playing with the toy, I realized my baby didn't have much interest in it anymore.  First of all, the toy requires more motor skills than most 6 month olds have.  The squeaky ball sometimes gets stuck and makes it hard to push the squeaker.  The toy is also real heavy, and I'm concerned it will fall on my child's face when she's lying down trying to play with it.  Her foot also gets stuck between the bars when she's really active. The paint on the caterpillar started coming off by the time she reached 8 months old.  It's okay to use if your child is actually interested in it and able to maneuver it. However, it seems that by the time your child is actually old enough to do the toy some justice, all interest in playing with it is gone.  As far as a teething toy is concerned, I would have rather invested in a rattler.

I thought this would be a good investment a couple months ago, but I was wrong...<br /><br />The first main issue I noticed with this set is that the bolts tend to loosen during use and when it happened to me, part of the frame bent because it wasn't supported properly anymore.<br /><br />The parts seem too cheap to be on a machine that costs $500+, which makes me even wonder why it costs so much. Not only that, but it is also very loud during use and smells like a chemical plastic spell.<br /><br />After I had to deal with this, I did some research and found an home gym I was more confident would be better and exactly what I was looking for. Luckily it has been the best machine I've ever used to work out with!<br /><br />It doesn't have any of the issues I mentioned above and I can't find a thing to complain about in over a month!<br /><br />I got it here on Amazon too -----------&#62; http://amzn.to/1r7KMGa<br /><br />You won't regret getting that setup, but if you don't get it, at least I could warn you about this one after my experience!

This time the product I received was amzer and I could feel the difference, this product was very good and is working very well with my iphone 5. Highly recommended but make sure it is the real deal.

This product doesn't have me entirely convinced yet. But with that being said, my weight has always fluctuated quite a bit so it's hard to tell whether Garcinia really is as life changing for me as many other users are reporting. Maybe it's my metabolism or my eating habits (I usually skip breakfast and lunch, but go by on coffee until a light meal around 3pm and then eat a bigger meal in the evening). I started taking the Garcinia with my main evening meal but so far I can't tell whether it has really helped me. I will give it another month and then maybe switch to green coffee bean extract.

When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, go here ------&#62; http://amzn.to/1nsrbPn<br /><br />I promise, they are well worth what they cost. You cannot beat quality!!!

I was so excited when i came across this apple peeler. I was so tired of using my carrot peeler for my apples.<br /><br />I only gave this review 3 stars because the quality just isn't there. After the first use the spring broke on the peeler ring. I am still able to use the product it just doesn't spring back to take off the whole peel.<br /><br />I also wish the silver counter hook was mounted on the other side of the peeler. It does not hook to the counter the way it was designed.<br /><br />It was very east to install the handle just need a phillips head screw driver.

When we needed to print the apple located the Epson workforce 445. I learned to scan to the apple after we put the Epson disc in. It was a fast process. slow scanning but that is the Epson. It cost more but it is living up to our expectation. The apple was the best price anywhere. It arrived on time and packaged well. It is a new experience but easy to learn. Phone help is $100.

I bought this new set b/c the rectangular containers were presented to hold more but they don't so I returned them.

I bought these kitchen scissors because I saw it was voted Best Kitchen Scissors. I have children so it was great that it had a safety lock feature on it. They designed for comfort, which I can agree to that after having tried it. I am left handed and it fit well. I can use it for practically anything, which holds true to the meaning of multipurpose. However, I tried to wash it using the dishwasher and that did not turn out so well. I will have to handwash it, as recommended in the description. So please be aware of this. That is really my only complaint about the scissors and my reasoning for the three star.

This microwave came with plastic shrink wrapped over it. Sort of a thick shrink wrap which you have to remove. It's hard to tell it's there and it's a chore to get off. In fact, it appears they shrink wrapped the parts before they put it together, because the plastic stuff is in the seems where the oven is put together and that you can't get out. I never would have noticed it was there, but it covers the vents.<br /><br />Okay, once the thick plastic wrap is off, how does the microwave perform? As good as any other and it's attractive, but it's small, the interior I mean. I expected larger. The pizza oven could be bigger. The large frozen pizzas we get at Safeway are too big for it. Still, cut them in half and it performs okay. It's perfect for the ones we get at Costco. All in all, this microwave does the job, but I don't think I'd recommend it for someone who cooks a lot, because of it's size. But for a bachelor or bachelorette, it'd be perfect.

I wanted to like this product but just couldn't force myself to. Was so excited to buy it as it's cheaper than some of the well known brands, however it just doesn't cut it. Carrots came out only in short slices and zucchinis became mangled stuck together, and I just couldn't get it to work like advertized.

This painting is my serenity. Perfect for the bedroom and relaxation time. I prefer to have it somewhere I can look at it while I turn on my mini water fountain, as I listen to the sounds of the water and looking at this painting takes me to a place of complete peace. After a long stressful day at work, or as part as my meditation, this never fails me. It takes me to a dreamland while I am still awake. Having the extra added mini waterfall really brings out this artwork to an even larger scale of reality. If you enjoy peace, and clearing your thoughts, dim the lights and just let yourself go, and you will soon find yourself to be in that place of deep relaxation.

Moving forward with my recent healthy lifestyle I decided I wanted to monitor my weight. After looking through reviews I decided this was the one I wanted. Although, I found out it is not what I was looking for.<br /><br />First off, I tested the scale by placing a specified weight on it and each time it would miss the actual weight by 2-4 pounds being either higher or lower...<br /><br />This was pretty frustrating because sometimes even the smallest drop in weight makes me happy and keeps me motivated. I wanted something that would be accurate every time I stepped on it. I dealt with this for a little while before doing serious research and getting a scale that I LOVE.<br /><br />I have owned it for over a month now and can say it is accurate every single time! I check it every so often with a weight to be sure and it has never been wrong.<br /><br />I actually ordered it here on Amazon ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1lKSlNc<br /><br />This thing is magnificent! I hope I could help others by sharing my experience.

I gave these goggles as a gift to my brother's kids. They are participating in the swimming team and they spend a lot of time training every day so I thought that this will be a great gift for them. They were very happy and after using them at the training sessions, they told me that these are the best goggles they ever got. They said that the goggles are perfect and the straps adjustment is very easy. They liked the blue color very much because it is their favorite color. As they are using them for some time now, they didn't broke and the quality didn't change. I liked the one year quality guarantee, it is a great offer but I didn't use it till now. The visibility is very good for outdoor usage while it is not as good when used indoor, and this is why I gave it 4 stars. Over all, they are well made where they protect the eyes perfectly. I highly recommend this great product. Thumbs Up

I am streaming music from my basement to several rooms in my house. I have been looking for a solution that allows me to distribute music wirelessly. Some of the systems that I found from Logitech and Sonos were out of my budget. Also, Logitech stopped making their product. So I gave this transmitter a try. I am very pleased with the wireless range. I was a bit concerned given the small size of the transmitter unit. However, this set performed quite well in every scenario that I tried. I have located the receiver in all of my rooms and I am getting clean reception. What I like is that I can get addition receivers to place in multiple rooms. I don't know how many transmitters can be used at the same time but apparently they use a smart pairing feature that allows several transmitters to run within the same home. I don't really need the iPod cradle but this is a nice extra feature.

Interesting book. It is better than &#34;Predictably Irrational.&#34; Indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. But even in this book, Ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make SEEMINGLY irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. Our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.<br /><br />As long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the &#34;wizard's curtain.&#34; Nevertheless, modern U.S. Government is unlike any before. Citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. A broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. Yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. In the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? Of course not. Government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and INCREASING EXPENSES. Obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. If a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.<br /><br />Citizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. And now the People are behaving just like their government. This is what government &#34;nudging&#34; has created.<br /><br />For over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. With a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. And modern U.S. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. There are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. The government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. The government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. Why? To insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. Obama oligarch, Cass Sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as &#34;nudging.&#34;<br /><br />For example, during the recent &#34;subprime mortgage crisis,&#34; which Ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, EXCEPT the supposedly rational U.S. Government. Homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. Thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. Similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. In fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did NOT make imprudent loans. Investors in those loans also acted rationally. They understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. Thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. Finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the U.S. government. First, it &#34;incentivized&#34; imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. Then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage &#34;crisis.&#34;<br /><br />Over the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. Citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. Thus, contrary to Ariely's thesis, the forces of &#34;irrationality&#34; are not hidden. Irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. In fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. For example, the 1960s &#34;Great Society&#34; and &#34;War on Poverty,&#34; created more poverty. The War on Gun Ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. The welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. Despite billions spent on education; Math, Science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. This is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. Education does not make people successful. Rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. It is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. Instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. Amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. Incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! There is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.<br /><br />It is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the &#34;Cargo Cult&#34; islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). Like modern politicians, the Cargo Cult confused correlation with causation. Citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. Many academics and intellectuals, such as Ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. That is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. This is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. Government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the U.S. has done. The best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. Despite Ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality.

I read lots of reviews before I purchased.  I also heard about it on Dr Oz.  I read all "star”reviews, but decided to try it for myself. It was a good price.  I took it for about 2 weeks. Some reviews suggested taking it with food and water, so I did. I can't give a fair comment on weight loss effects because I feel  I wasn't on it long enough. Though I didn't lose a pound,  I moderately exercise everyday. Don't feel it really suppressed my appetite either. I gave product 3 stars because it may work for someone else.

This was a gift for my little brother. He loves it, but the nose and eyes are made of that iron on material that's on so many shirts that will crack and peel. That was okay because it normally lasts for a while, but even before he wore it the first time the nose was already cracking off. Pretty poor quality there. He doesn't care, he still loves it, but it's still kind of irritating. Also, the strings are really short. I know it's for boys, but it fit on both my head and my grandma's head, but the strings looked ridiculously short, even on my little brother (who is 7).

I don't know why people are dissing this laptop. I've had it for 3 years and the battery is still great. I even use this for gaming and it still runs smoothly. I had problems with it when I first bought it. The charging circuit wouldn't work and they had to replace it. But after that, it ran smoothly. The laptop can run Adobe Photoshop CS5 but lags a little. It's good enough for a student like me. 3 years ago, laptops were pricey and this fit my budget.<br /><br />My Cons:<br />It's too damn heavy if you want to bring it anywhere. My back hurts a lot after carrying it the whole day. It heats up really fast if you're gaming or programming. I actually got burns before when it got too hot and it was seated in my lap. The touchpad is annoying too, sometimes it moves itself even if I'm not even near it, but it happens rarely.

Adeline Yen Mah tells an interesting story of culture, abuse, and commitment. This was a new look for me at Chinese heritage. As a daughter from a wealthy Chinese family, she gives insight into the abuse that knows no economic boundary. She had a cruel Eurasian mother that added a whole new element to the traditional family. Adeline eventually moves from China to England and then to the US while trying to preserve her family ties back home. It was an interesting look at three cultures and how they affect our image of family. It was an interesting read but be prepared for a terribly abusive story.

I am trying to control my dog who hasn't learned obedience commands is exhausting and often nearly impossible. But teaching him simple commands from this book will make a world of difference and provide a great opportunity for bonding. So thankful for this book that is so much helpful. I have learned to keep in mind that puppies have short attention spans, and it is unreasonable to expect to have your puppy's full attention for a long period of time. Keep your sessions short at first to minimize distractions and maintain your dog's attention, gradually increasing the amount of time spent on training each day.

I lost a lot of weight taking these raspberry ketones, but I really wanted to lose it faster than this. I expected something like 50 pounds in a couple of months and instead I only lost 28 pounds in two months. I know that is still A LOT.<br /><br />On the other hand I never lost so much weight before as I did by taking this supplement. I didn't have a single side effect. No headaches, diarrhea or chest pains like other weight loss stuff make you have. Oh and I didn't have flatulence either. Some other pills I took caused me that a lot.<br /><br />So, this is actually a great product, I'm just an impatient guy. It took me years to get this fat and I want to get rid of it in months. I know that is crazy and it is my fault not the products.<br /><br />I think people should buy it and be patient with it. Even if it takes three months to lose all the weight it is worth it because you live longer when you lose the weight and are thin. Thin people don't get some diseases as often as fat people do. You don't get diabetes type II and you don't get high blood pressure as often.<br /><br />If people in your family have that stuff you need to be thin to not get it. So, buy these raspberry ketones before it is too late for your health.

This amplifier seemed like the perfect solution for my problem. I wanted an integrated solution to stream music from my iPhone to a pair of floor-standing speakers wirelessly. My speakers do not have wireless and I did not like having a separate wireless receiver and amplifier. Since my phone supports Bluetooth I gave this amp a try.<br /><br />It worked as long as the distance between my phone and speakers was within 20 feet before cutting out. The build quality seems a bit cheap but for the price I guess that is what you get.<br /><br />The real bummer however was the fact that there is a constant hiss in the audio. I think this hiss is generated by the amplifier itself. If I turn down the volume the hiss goes down. If I turn it up the hiss comes back. This is very annoying since I otherwise would have liked this product. Unfortunately this constant white noise is driving me crazy. I have since returned this unit and purchased a similar product from another vendor.

I would usually go for the fish oils. Of course the brand is always a lower price. I am unsure about how the quality compares. These are just as they say and I haven't had problems with the "fish oil burps" after taking them. That's about all I can say. I have been using Fish Oil since it has been deemed a healthy addition to one's diet. The only thing better than a good product is a good, cost effective product.

The charger is perfect for my needs. It has ample power and is convenient to carry around. I charge my iPhone and office phone (HTC Thunderbolt) with this and I can probably get at least a full charge for both phones from it. I have tried it on separate occasions and so far, I have not been able to get even 4000 mAh from it. Not a big deal for me because a full charge for each phone is all I need when traveling. But if you are counting on the full capacity as advertised, know that it is really more like 4k or so (roughly). Still pretty good given the compact size in my opinion.

I ordered this because I love latex pillows and have been trying to find a good match to one I have at home that is on its' last legs. This pillow is airy and comfy, but thicker than I'd hoped for :( It does have a very weird odor as everyone else has mentioned- I aired it out outside and then put an older, recently used pillowcase on top of it. The smell didn't bother me when I went to sleep, and seemed to have disappeared almost immediately- I've had the pillow for about a month now. I like enough to keep it, but I will not buy it again unless it comes in a thinner width.

So for the pros first:<br /><br />I use it on my face as an night time moisturizer and it seems to do the trick well. Absorbs and keeps my face hydrated.<br /><br />However, my intention was using this as a hair product. I am already currently using my night cream for my face at night which does an amazing job also and is slightly cheaper.<br /><br />As for hair product, I am switching from the blue label Moroccan oil to this and this one is oily and doesn't help with frizz as much.<br /><br />That is the reason for 2 star because I did not get to use it for what I want to.

It took me an hour to finally install Ooma Telo on a place where my phone was. I didn't think of calling a support because I read here that they were not that helpful. Once I installed it, I called a friend just to see if it works ( prior to that I had to activate product through their website, which was an annoying process). However, friend told me that he couldn't hear me well and that he noticed a repeat of every word I say. I didn't knew what happened, since I updated software online to the newest version, so we changed places and I got onto his phone and he on Ooma. I noticed the same thing, low volume and slight delay, which really ruined the whole experience. At last I returned the item and made a fair exchange...<br /><br />I got myself a new Telo Home Service ( http://amzn.to/1vBqHZ5 ), which wasn't malfunctioned. I did had slight problems in installing it but I solved it as it wasn't a factory mistake. It worked like a clock, so I'll stick to it for now on.

I had very high expectations from this book but after reading it, I was a bit disappointed. Even though this book has some very important lessons to teach us, I still think there were so many things missing out in it. I really like how the author relates us humans with animals, but there could have been so much more than merely just relating the two species and giving a few examples.<br /><br />I love Natura and tend to follow it all the lessons it I learn from it. It is filled with if not millions but thousands of new ways to inspire and motivate the humans, however this book lacked that spark you expect when talking about nature. So for me, its below than what I had expected. Hence the 2 stars. Thank you

This carseat has great reviews in terms of how safe it is.  A look at the reports and stats involved with testing this carseat are impressive.  What they forgot in designing this carseat, however, is comfort (both for the Mom and the Baby).  My baby HATES sitting in this carseat.  It's super-narrow and deep.  Maybe the depth is what makes it so safe but I wonder if it's worth it to have your baby be uncomfortable each and every time you take a car ride. In terms of discomfort for the Mom: this car seat is heavy and bulky.  I hurt my back hauling it with a three week old so I would suggest really thinking about how much you might be moving the car seat around (I live in NYC and I take the car seat out to use in its frame as a stroller--or I used to until I decided to get rid of this monster).<br /><br />I got this car seat off of my registry and was really thankful for it but this thing is a beast!<br /><br />My husband and I recently purchased a comparatively cheap Graco carseat to use at his parents' home and my baby LOVES it.  He can flex this little legs and he slept, well, like a baby in it.

I'd like to say I really liked these 'jumbo' dinosaurs. But they are not even jumbo at all. They aren't tiny, but by far jumbo.They are all less than 6 inches in length, and being this smaller size isn't really the big problem. What bugs me about this set, or at least the one that I received, is that there are 4 duplicate dinos. Not just the same dinosaur in a different pose, but I mean 4 exact duplicates. When I pay for 12 dinosaurs, I expect at least 12 dinosaurs in different poses, regardless if there is an occasional same dinosaur, but not 12 dinosaurs with 4 having an exact duplicate twin. The quality is not the worst I have seen before, however in many I can clearly see the mold imprint melted into the dinos. So several look like they have had an operation, and split entirely apart and melted back together. But, what do you expect from anything now days that has 'Made In China' stamped on the bottom. Overall, I'll rate these 3 stars, and lucky they get that. Would not recommend to toddlers, but only kids 5 and up, and expect them to cry when they get 4 exact duplicate dinosaurs.

As you can tell from the title this book it is about grace. Gods Grace. What is? How to get it? How to understand it? With that comes what it can do for you, what it has done and why we want it. Max Lucado doesn't disappoint in this book. If you have read his earlier works than you know how he writes and how he sets things up. He has a particularly dry sense of humor. Some things he says makes you go Huh? Then you realize he made a joke. If you have read Lucado before you know what I am talking about. I love the way he explains things. He makes you understand through stories and never feels like he is preaching to you. Its like having a conversation with a friend.<br /><br />"God's grace--His unconditionally loving, unmerited favor--is sometimes difficult for people to grasp, even though each one of us is in desperate need of it. But in Max Lucado's new book, GRACE, it is completely embraceable and understandable. Through Lucado's characteristic narrative style and profound biblical understanding, we learn that God's grace is truly much more than we deserve and greater than we imagine. " --Dr. Charles F. Stanley<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that helps you understand grace through Christ, you like Max Lucado or enjoy Christian Fiction then try out this book.

So, first of all, the ad shows varying colors. The colors I got varied, but THEY WEREN'T THE COLORS ON THE AD. Amazon shows these very light, pastel-like colors. I got bold greens, reds, blues, and purples.  I should know better than to purchase something so cheap, but this was ludicrous. The majority of them wouldn't “lock" into place and the other ones take a ridiculous amount of strength to set. After doing some research, I found an even cheaper (and better quality) brand. Give Clover a shot and don't waste your time with these.

Instead of dying, he woke one night later and went to recover with a male friend. On top of depression he was a closet homosexual. His parents reported him missing. When that made the news, his male friend panicked and passed him to another male friend and then on to another until all of them were panicked thinking they were going to get blamed for his murder or abduction. Eventually the poor boy makes it home to his parents, but not until after aother failed suicide attempt. It doesn't end well either. It's a good read, but not for fun.

This was my first touchscreen phone; I got it because it was a good price, but I really regret buying it. At first it was okay, but I've had it for about 9 months now, and I get extremely frustrated with it.<br /><br />The lag is HORRIBLE. If I try to call someone, it usually takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 3-4 minutes to actually place the call. It gets really frustrating. I'll press the call button and wait a few minutes before it actually calls. A lot of the time I'll receive a call from the person while I'm trying to call them because they're tired of waiting for the call to go through. Then I'm dialing them and they're calling me at the same time, and hanging up ends both the calls and we have to start over. It's pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />The apps freeze and crash a lot - and not just downloaded apps, ALL of the apps on the phone. If I go to my contacts and try to call someone, the app freezes and says it has to close and I have to reopen it. This happens a lot with messaging, too. I'll try to click on a message and the app freezes and force closes. Also, there's a weird glitch where I open a message and try to type, and it won't let me. I have to tap on the message box over and over again, sometimes for a couple of minutes, before it finally lets me type. If I type a word, it shows that I'm trying to type it and then deletes each letter as I type it.<br /><br />The memory is pretty bad. I was going to just get an SD card and use it to store apps and stuff so I could have more on the phone, but most of the apps won't even go on the SD card and have to be stored on the phone, so there's really no point. I have barely anything on my phone (maybe 5 apps and 150-200 pictures), and the memory is full.<br /><br />Another weird glitch I've been having is when I press the unlock button, nothing happens, and I have to press it about ten times before it actually responds and lets me unlock the phone.<br /><br />Overall a really crappy phone - I do NOT recommend getting it. It looks good at first, but the lag and horrible memory make it a very bad choice. If I had the money to get a new one, I would in a heartbeat so I wouldn't have to deal with this piece of crap anymore. I want to throw it at a wall every time I try to use it.

Alright, this is a review that is based on my first week of experience. Everything is pre-installed, you don't have to do anything except connect to your screen and power supply. Of course, there are optional applications that came with a disc. Activation code is labeled on the computer. Everything works out fine. All the driver updates and applications that are necessary for your hard drive took about 10% of storage, something that I found some people do complain about. But nothing useless is found, unlike majority of pc on the market. Now as for gaming. It does allow you to run majority of games that are available. However, keep that in mind, lots of games have low requirements, so this hardware works just fine. I use mmohut as reference, but a lot game review sites have similar rating on games. For their top rate games, this computer is nothing to brag about. Many popular games have way too high requirement that is just out of this computer's league. It does allow me to play certain game like Soul of Ultimate Nation at high setting very smooth. For a casual gamer, less intensive applications, and for $500, this computer is truly a steal. But if you want to run heavy intensive games like WoW, Terra, and so on; you can settle for low setting or do some serious upgrades. My new parts are arriving soon, so I will update as soon as I can.<br /><br />Update: I bought AMD Radeon HD 7850 ($210) to replace the graphic card that came with the machine. Now this is truly a gaming computer. Everything is above 7.0 in Windows Index except hard drive. The new graphic card makes the machine runs extremely quiet, unlike before which felt a trunk driving by every single time it is turned on. Although I did upgrade the memory ram to 16GB, which I don't think it's really necessary for everyone. My advice to everyone that want to play some of the popular game today, upgrade to a better graphic card. Another thing I notice is that my computer's motherboard is GA-78LMT-S2, while current product description is ASRock 960GM-GS3 FX. They probably changed to the newer one.<br /><br />My rating still remains. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do want to run the games I like in medium to high settings smoothly. This is also my first time to purchase a built PC and have upgrade it myself. I'm ok with what it is, and can be upgraded quite easily.

This is a good Jasmine tea. Not great but good.  Its light as green teas tend to be but the jasmine gives it a soothing aroma and interesting taste.  The only thing is that it does have an odd taste I can't put my finger on. Not that it's bad, it's not at all, just leaves you wondering, "What is that flavor?" It's interesting to say the least.  Otherwise, this is an extremely relaxing tea as most Jasmines tend to be.<br /><br />I would have preferred a smaller size to start with but this was the only option, at least on amazon.  I also ordered a higher grade version of jasmine at the same time; [[ASIN:B00HFMON0Y Organic Jasmine Pearls Loose Leaf Green Tea 4 oz. + FREE Blueberry Pomegranate White Tea 2 oz]]  Hhmm, that free blueberry pom was not offered to me in my last order.  Anyway, I steeped this tea for 5 minutes and was just amazed by its fragrance.  I love the amazing floral note from this jasmine, no foreign taste in this one that I cannot put my finger on.  If you can afford it, always go with high grade leaves.

I was horrified to see the recipes are pretty basic (designed for kindergarten kids) and doesn't' even have 1 picture. For example, the author Michael Matthews tells me how to make PEANUT BUTTER AND OATMEAL, do I really need to be taught how to mix peanut butter and oatmeal in a bowl? Put it in a microwave and eat it for breakfast? Unless I'm missing a brain cell, I think it's appalling to call this simple breakfast a recipe!! And very unhealthy to suggest I use a microwave to cook most of the meals!! Also there's lots of typing errors all over the place, as if it's been hastily copied and pasted. I had expected a lot more after reading all the positive reviews but I'm very disappointed, it seems you can't always trust what you see, if it looks too good to be true most of the time it isn't true. This is an okay book with average recipes nothing more than 1 or 2 stars.

Luke is one of those self-assured, kiss 'em and they swoon kind of men that some romance writers like to write about, but that I don't like to read about, but he has character and lots of good qualities and that pulled the book up a lot in my estimation. A very nice and enjoyable read.

Honestly I had high hoped for this product but it disappointed me. I got it from the Supercuts promo for free, and my barber said it would work on my thinning hair. Well it did actually work, but it took over 6 months for me to see results! You're better off chopping off all your hair, unless you have a ton of patience. Also a negative is how high the price is for this product. At the mall they're selling it for over $70 PER BOTTLE. This is just far too high. The sales lady was nice enough, very attractive and convincing in trying to buy it but I'm not going to give up $70 just because she smiles at me. Anyway, that's my 2 cents.

as a diabetic I have to be really careful what I put into my drinks etc but I have been hearing a lot about macha and I was curious if it was ok for diabietis. I bought this book because it let me pay what I want but I was expecting low quality because of that. It is actually a really nice book. I dont really see specific information for diabetics bu t I do see that its very natural and the benefits are impressive so ill probably purchase some. i will ask my doctor before taking to be sure.

When I bought the black leggings I thought they were okay, they didn't fit as comfortably as I would of wanted. But since I paid premium for these leggings, I thought I would give it a shot. So I went to the Gym in them and every single guy and girl kept telling me that these the portion in the back were way too transparent and were able to see through. I have to admit that I do not like to wear underwear when I use leggings, so you can imagine what was the reaction.<br /><br />I felt so embarrassed, these leggings are are revealing in the back, since I couldn't tell from the front much. I will have to trow these leggings to the trash, not work everyone making funny faces at me.

Lead contamination of matcha is a real problem in China! I understand that lead has been entering the River Yangtze and East China Sea as a result of poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen 1999). Water irrigations systems for farms obtain water from the River Yangtze! As a result the tea plants do get contaminated with lead. Even organic farms in China are at risk. In 2006 Han et al showed that 32% of 1225 tea samples from China contained lead at levels that exceed the maximum permissible concentration. In 2013 Consumer Lab dot com advised people not to consume matcha from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha! The only way to be sure about the purity of the matcha is to see a lab report on the amount of lead in the matcha. Lead can damage any organ in the body including the brain, causing learning and behavioural problems and also problems with doing arithmetic or language problems.<br />I think it is important that a lab report on lead content of the matcha is uploaded on to Amazon by one organic as it is a matter of food safety. Until then I will not drink this matcha which clearly says on the back of the pack that it is a "Product of China”. It is an important issue. Once I have seen the lab report on Amazon I will write what I thought about the appearance and taste of this matcha.<br /><br />It is useful to read "SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA” and the Consumer Lab dot com article which you can find online. They are a real eye-opener!

Overall, I think this is a cool product.  I had a lot of fun using it but it was bulky and hard to hold.  Maybe I have tiny hands.  My son wanted to use this so I let him try.  He's 11 and he really wasn't able to do much with it since he had to hold it with two hands but he had fun trying which is what is most important.  I wish this was rechargable so there wasn't a cord.  I did make some fun little things and after about 20 minutes I got the hang of it and it made it easier.  I will be buying more plastic for it because I do like it a lot and think that with some practice I will be able to make some pretty cool things.  There are just some design issues I wish could be addressed which is why I gave it three stars.

This is a decent bed with lots of storage. It is huge, yes. If you took the time to read the measurements and actually measure the space in the room before buying it you will know what you are getting. I got this for my preteen-teen and he loves it. There is a LOT of storage in it. It will take several HOURS to put together and you need 2 people for some of it. Some of the material is less than stellar but for the price I was not expecting high quality wood. Only appropriate for older kids or teens. An adult would not appreciate having to climb into it at night.

Light stands were fairly heavy duty and I should be able to use them with my other mono lights. The triggers worked almost every time.

I guess I should have read the negative reviews more carefully because this stylus results you get from this stylus are pretty poor for the high price they charge.<br /><br />The pen has several faults starting with where the power button is located. I had to constantly try and rotate the pen so I wouldn't hit the power button.  Very annoying<br /><br />Next the so called worlds best stylus couldn't even capture my signature any better than my cheap 5 dollar griffin stylus.<br /><br />I honestly feel like I was ripped off<br /><br />Ok so then I gave the stylus to my friend who is a professional graphic artist to test it and see if it was just me that was having issues.  After 10 minutes of use she told me this was not worth the money I spent and directed me to buy something different.<br /><br />I can say that this stylus does NOT take notes very well and you spend more time trying to correct the poor results than just trumping a note or using a cheapie stylus<br /><br />I've decided that my 5 dollar griffin will do better than this 70 dollar toy<br /><br />My search continues for a good active stylus<br /><br />Trust me and avoid this at all costs

I didn't had any problems with this router, since I read all the positive reviews and decided to buy one for my newly purchased laptop. The problem started after my second firmware update. In the beginning everything was normal but after the update, router would constantly lose signal. Now, every 2 minutes my wifi disconnects for no apparent reason - and this didn't happened before, so I called support but they told me to reset the router, which I did, but problem continued. Luckily, I had a warranty so I returned the router.<br /><br />On my friend's recommendation, and he works at local internet service provider, I bought AC1759 Router ( http://amzn.to/13FE6I1 ), which didn't had any problem. I updated the last firmware and I didn't noticed a big change, so as long as it's working normally, I'm glad :).

lf you still didn't bought this, then this review can help you. I've been playing violin for 3 years now and I can recognize one when I see it. After I saw that this one was one of the bestselling here and that it had mostly positive reviews, I decided to buy one. After I received it I spotted bent neck and spotty craftsmanship. But the worst thing happened when I tried to play it. The sound was awful, and the strings were too stretched - definitely not my recommendation :/.    My friend, who's a violin player in orchestra, bought a Cecilio violin ( http://amzn.to/1xAJ6IL ), a week ago from Amazon and it was far more better than this one, Sound is better, and the craftsmanship is perfect, I just ordered the same :).

Lather Bamboo Creme Hair Wash.  This stuff is AWFUL!!  As soon as I put it on my head and try to rub it in, my hair becomes a ratty mess!!  I don't know if it's because my hair is color treated, but this is unbelievable.  There should be a warning.  I spent 45 minutes brushing the rats out of my hair and had a very sore head for almost 2 days.

I bought these pail refill bags to go with my pail and I am really happy with them.  I bought the system before I had my baby boy, a couple of months ago, and I am not unhappy with either the pail or these bags.<br /><br />At the moment, my baby's diapers are very small and therefore, the bags do hold 25 diapers, quite easily.  However, I should imagine that as his diapers get bigger, the bags will hold less of them.  At the moment, it is a bit of a squeeze to get the bags out of the pail, but they never break.  They snap shut really easily and firmly, ensuring any smells are kept inside - which is ALWAYS a good thing with diapers.  I am very satisfied with these.

A lot smaller that I imagined. The picture looks great and it does look ok but I am not using it for what I intended. I wanted to use as a lounge chair but the back is too low and it's not long enough for someone 5'8&#34;. I would say if you are about 5'3&#34; it would work for you. Look at the measurements before making a purchase. I set it up after the 30 days so I had to make use of it. Nice to have the storage and I can sit in it for a bit just not to lounge for too long.

Bought this char weeks ago, can't remember how long has it been already, the chair is still sturdy, comfortable to use to be honest except I'm having second thoughts that I might fall because I lean too much and I'm a big and heavy man so hopefully it holds up ( well, it is until now ). The arm rest are pretty smooth too.  The chair itself is soft and pretty thick so it must be of a high quality. So far everything is good except for the wheels, I put on some oil into it since it makes this squeeze sound whenever I move.

I received this hat quickly. I like that it has Velcro tabs to hold it into the trifold shape. It also makes it possible to wear it without the trifold.

The biggest problem was, once I received lighting bulb pack, the thing that to remove a single bulb, you must remove all bulbs by resetting the hue bridge to factory default & building the system from the ground up. I had to call a repairman to do this, and when he saw what I bought he laughed at me. He wondered how I got Ethernet cable and in here it said wireless, so I had to put on other wall plug, which was hard, due to &#34;modern&#34; look of my house. Android app is also not helpful, it updates every hour or so and it really ruins the whole process, because I cannot stand by my mobile every time.<br /><br />Nevertheless, my friend who was lightning designer, said that I needed to buy a Phillips 2599 ( http://amzn.to/1wBs8pI ), because its completely wireless and it's easier to install it, he also bought a pack of them, a month ago and said he'll order more because of their quality.

Pros: Concept of a case with an attachable strap to work as an armband. That's really about it.<br />Cons: Silicone material does not work well for work outs or running, except maybe very light workouts. It sticks to the arm with no flexibility to allow free movement of the arm. I usually run 3-4 miles followed by 25 minutes of strength training. This armband was painful to wear for more than a mile. When I removed it after the run, the skin is flaming red in that spot.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I think a more flexible material that doesn't cause so much friction would be better suited for this design. This material in itself is too painful to wear.

I am a small woman with small ears so, the size of these earrings was perfect for me. They were beautiful and dainty. The color is exactly what I was going for (although the color of the pearl on the earrings was different than on the necklace).

I think it's a great little pack, honestly. It looks great, for one, and is made with good, sturdy materials that are able to stand up to a lot of use. The zippers are especially nice, very high quality. I can carry it or wear it, and either way it's highly functional. Lots of space inside, too. It didn't smell great when I first got it, though, like a very strong kind of fake smell, but it dissipated after a few hours being out of the shipping material. Weird, but I didn't let it deter me.

In my opinion this is a good start to a system.<br /><br />This is fine for a bedroom or smaller sized living area. This will not replace your surround sound system. The wattage rating and speaker size reinforces this point. That being said, the quality of the tower is up to par.<br /><br />* Quality enclosure<br />* No assembly required<br />* iPod mates to tower<br />* Remote mates to iPod<br />* Secure line Jacks<br />* MP3 Aux-in Jack<br />* FM radio with 20 preset<br />* Composite video output<br /><br />These are all good working features and those without functional glitches.<br /><br />An area that could be improved:<br /><br />AM stations seem to be non-existent. Perhaps FM stations are only received.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />The tower is priced well and the quality of the audio is very good. We purchased the tower for our sons room and in that space the tower works well.

They do not require huge force to work perfectly. They don't splatter mouse guts all over the place or make a bloody mouse mess. Also, they don't really hurt if they release on your finger (hard to do since you're finger is never in the trap). They grab and suffocate the mouse. Awesome design, works terrific, an ant could set it off and it's practically impossible for mice to raid the bait without triggering the trap so even tiny mice get got.

The "paper" shading does soften the light though making it easy to function without a glare. It takes the tiny E12 bulbs (three of them). Another nice feature is the on/off foot switch. It was incredibly easy to assemble (i think it took me a grand total of two minutes to put it together and plug it in).

This movie is almost two and a half hours long. All-in-all it is a fun take on the old tale. (no new plot here, save for the in depth look at Tonto's past) Some Texas Rangers get ambushed and only one survives, leaving a Lone Ranger. A dead brother who's wife loved them both at one point, gives us a great damsel, add her impressionable son, a corrupt train mogul, a scary outlaw who eats parts of his victims, and a pair of hero's that carry the film with their antics, and you've got a good western romp. Depp plays a great Tonto, especially, the old Tonto that starts the flick.  My only negative is this: Two hours of  s - l - o - w  build up for thirty minutes of over the top climax is not that great of a ratio for a film. Thirty minutes of it could have been edited out and the thing would have been perfect.  4 stars, A "Must See" for fans of westerns, Depp, and The Lone Ranger. - MR

I had high hopes for this movie. Winona Ryder's in it, after all. But those hopes were quickly dashed once I got into this corny and very stupid movie. Our hero, a rather studly guy played by Simon Baker, gets an e-mail with the names of all the girls he's been to bed with and all the ones he is going to bed. However, he's just about to tie the knot. Now if you were a stud would you get married, if you all of a sudden knew you were going to bed a gaggle of gals in the very near future?<br /><br />Winona plays Death Nell, a goth girl who goes around putting guys to sleep. She give them a potion and they go into a coma. Well, she inadvertently kills one. Naturally she's the last girl on the list and Mr. Stud doesn't want to go there, but can he help himself, can he quit taking good looking hotties to bed, even if he wants to? That is the question and that question is so silly that you might want to give this movie a pass. Still, it didn't suck, so if you're in the video store and can't decide what to get, Winona Ryder is in the movie and that has to account for something.

I ordered a pack of 5 of the 2 GB SD cards. Adata brand, put one in my camera took photos only to be so disappointed in the quality, bottom half of photos were missing, colored lines through all the photos that did actually take. Thought maybe it was just one bad one, but tried all 5 and none of them work properly. I even tried them in other electronic devices I have and none of them worked in anything. Big waste of my time waiting a week to get them and then they do not work. Don't waste your money like I did.

The Perfect Fitness Ab Carver Pro was the first piece of equipment I purchased when I decided to create a home gym.  Along with this, a jump rope, and a waist trimmer belt, I lost 70 pounds over the past 7 months.  If you are just starting out, I'd recommend it be the first piece of equipment you get as well because it allows you to focus on the most important part of the body, THE CORE, which you should focus on first especially when you are just getting started or back into a workout routine.<br />I am not what you would call a bargain shopper (more like an impulse buyer ha) because if I were, I would have realized that you can get this same brand, and same model at Walmart for 10 dollars less than what it is selling for on amazon which is currently $39.95.  The Ab-Carver Pro is available on the Walmart web site right now for $29.77, so with the added tax (how does Amazon get away with not charging tax btw), you'll still save a fist full of dollars.<br /><br />If that is still too steep for you, and I totally understand if it is - still a lot of money to spend on a couple pieces of plastic, the best priced ab wheel I found on here appears to be this one for only $7.00 - [[ASIN:B00J0F3DR8 Wacces Ab Power Wheel Ab Roller]].  So, that is a good price, a great price actually.  Now you are probably asking yourself if you can get an ab wheel for such a ridiculously low price and it will do the job, then why on earth would you spend almost six times that amount and get the Ab Carver Pro!?<br /><br />While I think it may be overpriced, there are TWO key features on the Ab Carver Pro which make me not regret the purchase.  I only regret not getting it at Walmart lol.<br /><br />Key Feature #1:  The Wheel size is very very wide.  This makes a huge difference especially in the beginning.  The wider wheel provides more stability and the increased stability gives room for a greater range of motion which means more muscles are being contracted during the movement.  This translates into getting and seeing results a lot quicker.  When I first started, I highly doubt I could have even completed one full rep on a classic ab wheel but on this I was able to do sets of 6-7 full reps from day one.<br /><br />TIP FOR BEGINNERS:  Start on a wall, no kidding.  Lean into the wall at about 45% angle and start with higher reps of 15 up to 30.  Once you can do three full sets of 30 reps take it to the mat (or the knee pads they provide which I don't use personally)!<br /><br />Key Feature #2:  The Contoured handles really help with different angles.  Thr great thing about not being in the gym is I'm not stuck in those ab machines which force you to move in one range of motion over and over again hitting the same muscle fibers the same way, every time.  The handles it easy to hit every angle of your ab and core by moving in slightly different directions with each repettiton. With the Ab Carver, you can literally move in 20 different angles and better still, it doesn't bother my wrists either (like typing this review does for example!).<br /><br />The only other two pieces of equipment I have used and still use in my "home gym" are, as I mentioned earlier, a jump rope and a waist trimmer belt.<br /><br />I went through a couple jump ropes before landing on this one;  [[ASIN:B00GGKPCPG Buy Jump Ropes Double Unders Jump Rope]].  My biggest tip here is to make sure you get one that is adjustable in length like this one.  If its too long you're not going to be able to pick up enough speed when you get good at it for it to be effective and if its too short, then your going to have painful welts on your forehead and on the top of your head for a while!<br /><br />I went through more than a couple waist trimmers belts unfortunately until I found the one I own now.  Many of these belts are, to be frank; crap.  They are thrown together without much effort and after you sweat in it a few times, it starts to fall apart.  I've been using the one I have now for the past 6 months, so as hard as it is to do, I think this particular belt actually changed my mind about ab trimming belts in general.  I always wear this during my cardio (i.e. running outside) and especially when I use the jump ropes.  I would not suggest wearing one while you are using the Ab Carver but for cardio and jumping rope this thing will make you sweat in the midsection and burn calories like no tomorrow.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KWIOF2Y TNT Waist Trimmer Ab Belt: Stomach Fat Burner & Toner &#x2605; Extra Wide to Cover Entire Midsection &#x2605; Uniquely Designed to Repel Sweat & Moisture w/ Anti-Slip Grid Technology &#x2605; No Slipping or Movement of Fabric! Premium Body Shaper, Slimm...]]<br /><br />I love the ab carver, adore my jump ropes, and I'm wearing my waist trimmer right now as I type this review (no kidding!)...but none of these tools would have done a darn thing to help me reach my weight loss goals if I didn't first lay the foundation with a set of healthy eating habits.  I hate the word diet, so I'll use "healthy eating habits".  These pieces of equipment I've mentioned will help, but if you want to really see those abs ya got to watch what eat.  And trust me I wish there was a way around this one because I love salty food but there is most certaintly not - Good luck friends!

As usual when you get something new, I was excited to use this TV in my living room. Although, that couldn't be further from what happened...<br /><br />When using one of the HDMI ports, the picture was very fuzzy and nothing seemed to fix that. Also, the picture quality was worse than the TV I was replacing from 5 years ago!<br /><br />This was so hard for me, after spending so much money and to be worse off than I was before.<br /><br />After I dealt with returning this TV and researching as much as possible I found a GREAT 50 inch TV that hasn't given me a single issue in any way.<br /><br />If you want to take a look, it is here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/1vi1LHp<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the TV for you, at least I got to share my experience with this one.

We wanted a couple of water balloon launchers for a party we were having so we picked up this one and a few others. Over the course of the party we definitely became partial to another launcher, [[ASIN:B004FRXKEW 300 Yard Water Balloon Launcher]]. While this one worked it didn't launch as far as the Bam Launcher and it didn't seem as durable. The CX Blaster launcher felt like it was made from lower quality rubber and there was visible wear after an afternoon of heavy use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun toy but I wouldn't really suggest the CX Blaster over one of the Bam Launchers.

You would imagine that the title of this review refers to the fact that this camera is much more than a point and shoot. Unfortunately it' s not. The fact that it needs a dozen of settings to run, makes it quite complicated and you might miss a few good photos because of that. The hardest time that I had was when I tried to connect it to WiFi.<br />The photos that it makes are nice (once you manage to do all the necessary settings).

Would recommend it to my fellow pet lovers who always love to bring in their dogs or cats. Its pretty simple to assemble to your back seats except for one thing. It constantly moves around and constantly losing grip of the belt. We have to, of course, fix it constantly as well so it gets annoying. Other than that, it’s easy to clean, no stinky odors are stuck to it and my dog seems loving it. I just hope there’s a better way to fix the moving around seat cover problem. Nevertheless, I gave it 3 stars since I still love the idea and the design along with it.

I was excited to get this necklace because i love kingdom hearts, i waited what seems like fovever for this (5 days) and it loked really well made so i ordered it.  The day i got the item, the package was amazing and it had sora on it as exepected and when i opened it the chain was perfect then after about 3 minutes the keyblade broke it wan't under any kind pressure it wasn't even exposed to heat or water.  I thougt i could wear it even though it broke after a while (around 15 mins.) the chain (wich isn't even metal) the coating started to peel of i was diapointed, if you want to wear a necklace i purpose you look elese where if you want a long-lasting necklace i suggest the Heartless necklace or the set of sora's keyblade pendant set.  Overall the product is really cheap and i don't think it matches the price but this is my view consider this as only a view on the necklace.

This post has been slightly moderated to satisfy Amazon's rules of posting.<br />This is a smaller overview that will enable people to see more easily what the full PDF is about. It shows why there is a need for a rebuttal. Morgan attacked by book with lies as I can show. Those who then wish to proceed to the full PDF will be welcome. My web site is at PROBITYPRESS.COM.<br />JOHN MORGAN: A FRAUDSTER EXPOSED<br />IF ANYONE WISHES TO ASK QUESTIONS, OR MAKE A STATEMENT, I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO RESPOND TO YOU ALL PERSONALLY.<br />I have written a book called The Princess Diana Conspiracy that has been attacked by a fraudster called John Morgan. Morgan has written a load of rubbish about my book and said there are two hundred errors in it and then expands that onto 500. One of Morgan's team of loyal "reviewers", Hiram, has arbitrarily increased that number to 600. It is all an exaggerated corruption.<br />This is a logical way for MI6 to progress their campaign. But they would also like you to read Morgan's rubbish because he espouses corrupt inquest evidence and so supports their purpose. If you fall for it, then Diana will become a fading footnote of history but the monarchy will also be safe for another number of years until it finally succumbs to the inevitable but too late for Diana's justice.<br />To all those souls that demand justice for Diana I ask you to consider the points I make. It will take a little of your time but Diana will benefit from your diligence and be closer to being avenged. You will follow my logic; most will recognize the truth having read this PDF.<br />I place you on my web, just before the PDF.<br />God bless<br />Alan<br /><br />JOHN MORGAN: AN UNPLEASANT BUT NECESSARY REBUTTAL<br />INTRODUCTION<br />An unpleasant task follows; one I cannot sidestep. Someone called John Morgan from Brisbane, Australia has compiled several books about Diana over the last few years taken directly from the Diana inquest transcripts. My book is sellingwell; his aren't selling. He has attacked my book with a criminal, so called, "review" that is false so I must put the record straight. Morgan's books are seriously flawed but I must also illustrate his purpose in writing his odious and corrupt little so called "review". Here is a free PDF download. I ask that you please make the ultimate judgement.<br />OVERVIEW<br />My book, the Princess Diana Conspiracy, has sold well and convinced many people about Diana being murdered; this hasn't pleased MI6. They tried to prevent my book from reaching the US market by sending my first book shipment back to the UK. Amazon.com was also later persuaded that my book was made of "hazardous materials"; this prevented it's availability around the time I was on four US TV shows and five US radio shows in September which was a critical time for my book's exposure. I also appeared on the Geraldo at Large show in New York and wasn't told I would be met by Imogen Lloyd Webber (MI6) who tried hard to debunk my views. Now MI6 recruit a failed author to assist them.<br />MI6 use Morgan's services because he is more concerned about money than justice for Diana. He has written several boring, disastrous books and has latched onto "The Princess Diana Conspiracy" to advertise them. He wrote his "review" based on his flawed opinions, not facts. Despite acknowledging that the inquests evidence is corrupt, he uses this same material to debunk my book and to write all of his own books; it is all he has. How anyone can write an account of what happened to Diana by using this same corrupt evidence and without challenging it, escapes me. MI6 had ten years to sanitize evidence and Morgan's views reflect the inquests findings, thus showing that he supports MI6.<br />I show that a huge number from Morgan's list of my supposed "errors" are either complete nonsense, his ignorance of the pre inquest evidence or his own baseless opinions. Morgan suggests his opinionsare indisputable and other "errors" are what he calls my "Power Constructs"; these are where he doesn't accept the evidence I present because he doesn't possess it. All are my supposed "errors" and a large number of examples are shown in the PDF. Morgan didn't start looking into the details about this vile crime until 2006. I began in 2003 so I use this pre inquest evidence to challenge the evidence that emerged from the inquest. Morgan perversely extolls the inquest evidence whilst also stating it is corrupt.<br />He attacks me by saying that "All investigative books-I include my own-have some errors. That is not the issue. The issue here is the level and type of error". So he pins the justification for his attack not on any errors but on the level and type of my supposed errors that apparently indicate I am working with MI6 (I am not). So, if you are content that the examples I show in the PDF illustrate Morgan's point is rubbish, and you may even regard his comments as pathetic, you will clearly see his purpose.<br />This was not a labour of love but done out of necessity. If we are to have justice and bring the truth to light then I need to clarify Morgan's purpose and send him to your mercy; not of my choice. Please find the time to read the full review on my web and take your own stance. Don't let this man pervert the course of justice now when my book takes us so close. Demand justice for Diana, Princess of Wales and deny MI6 their hard fought for victory.<br />PDF FOLLOWS ON WEB<br /> (I did make mistakes in The Princess Diana Conspiracy and have apologised. But these genuine errors were corrected and published as an eBook three weeks before Morgan's corruption emerged so his pathetic comments about my MI6 association and raising false flags etc., by deliberately giving out false information, are proven untruths; he knew I was pursuing justice. I had already corrected the genuine errors earlier so clearly wasn't trying to laya false trail. Please understand this point because it's the bedrock of Morgan's excuse for his corruption and proves this man is a criminal. I have now finished a review of my entire book and it is being typeset; it will be with the printers next week and also an update will be sent for the eBook. I shall also be extra careful when I send the files to the printers this time to ensure they arrive intact-more later.)

I've got 2 iPhones and several iPods in the family. Every car has a car charger and every room in the house has an AC charger. As everyone knows, no matter what you do to try and conserve battery life on the iPhone, you inevitably run out of power. Ever since I got the QCell, that problem no longer exists. The QCell is small enough to just throw in your backpack, briefcase, purse, etc and know that you are covered. The charge time to get the phone back to a "worry-free" level is quite impressive. Those marathon conference calls that seem to occur when you are away from a power source used to be an issue. The long airline flights where you are playing a game on the iPhone, and even though you are in airplane mode, the battery still doesn't last. Well, with the QCell, both those problems is solved. The led comes in handy too when you are in a bind. The laser pointer is nice too, but I don't think I will ever use it. There are plenty of miniscule laser pointers out there, that are more comfortable and convenient to use.

She does prefer an open cup but it requires a lot of parental/caregiver effort to help her drink from one without spilling everywhere, so these sippies are a good choice all around. It took her some time to figure out the cup but she's a pro at it now.Inexpensive replacement valves (I used to poke the valves thru the spikes in the top rack to wash, and wore them out quickly).

Nice mug in many ways, but I can't use the lid because when I do, my coffee develops a sort of horrible plastic-y musk within a minute or two. I really dislike the plastic tops. In my opinion the plastic leeches into my hot drinks, giving it a nasty taste. Also the silicone around the cap leaves a nasty taste on the rim of the lid.The lid doesn't smell like anything to me when it's clean / prior to use and I've diligently scrubbed it, so I can only conclude that it's poor-quality plastic that's leaching something into my cup.

When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head during gaming or just casual use.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews. The price was great, but I should still expect to receive something worth actually using...<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, take a look at this one here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/181sLOx<br /><br />I have never been happier with any other headset and hope you get the same result if you decide to try one!<br /><br />If not, at least I got to share my experience with this headset!

I'm not a fan of Karaoke but my little niece is nine and thinks she's going to be the next Britney Spears. The little blue Karaoke machine is her favorite pastime. She's been using it since she was almost eight so it is super easy for a child or really anyone to use. The sound isn't bad either as long as you have someone decent on the microphone. It is a favorite for sleep overs and spontaneous moments with friends. If your child or little relatives love to show off and sing, this is a great buy. It keeps them entertained for hours.

I didn't know there was much difference between tennis balls until I tried these Championship XD balls to fill out my shopping basket. These are considerably heavier than the cheapest ones. They're accurate in the wind and have a strong rebound, which is good for wall practice.<br /><br />The reason it didn't get five star is because the first ball cracked open after only about 3 hours of play. I'm not sure if playing in the rain had anything to do with it but it's the only tennis ball I've ever broke so far. The second ball is holding up well however, it's still very firm even after the letters have worn out.

There are some lovely vignettes of expat family life in this compilation, most notable Susan Conley's exploration of hutong culture with her children, Alan Paul's lampoon-ish family adventure in Szechuan, Kay Bratt taking a disabled orphan under her wing, and Kaitlin Solimine's heart-warming homestay experience.<br /><br />But beware: this book lives up to its "Unsavory" title with several profane tales which left me shaken rather than stirred: not one but two stories about beatings (Hessler and Humes), an English teacher hitting on his female Chinese assistant (Matthew Muller), Nury Vittachi (a children's book writer for Scholastic no less!) interacting with gangsters and bar girls, Susie Gordon's glamorization of drug use and materialistic extravagance, SEVERAL baijiu (rice liquor) stories celebrating China's binge-drinking culture, and the editor Tom Carter's funny but nonetheless disturbing patronage of prozzies.<br /><br />Fortunately an anthology allows the reader to be selective, and there are a whopping 28 action-packed stories to choose from, so I still feel good about recommending this book to my network of expat families.

The way these are supposed to work is the suction cups grip the window and hold the shade up.  We tested both shades on window glass and the suction cups held for about 2 minutes before giving up.  These come with black suction cups.  We tried moistening the cups with water, they held about 10 seconds.  We tried the last resort, isopropyl alcohol and had similar results to water.  The whole idea is shot when the suction cups don't work.  The shade is well-made and folds up nicely.    Update on 1/27/2015:  Great Customer Service! The company informed me that I might have received an older pair of shades and will re-send a new pair to me.  I will update it after testing the new pair.    Update on 1/30/2015:  Sellers were very good to help us get a screen that works for us.  We now have a working screen and believe the suction cup problem is due to the suction cups being folded over in the package during shipping.  We're all set, thanks to the sellers help.

I've been taking this product for the last 4 days.  While I understand that I cannot fully review a product like this in this short amount of time there are some things that I already don't like about it which has me reconsidering this purchase in the first place.  First off all I ordered this via prime 2 day shipping. It took 4 days to arrive.  Strike one.  Secondly, the way this product is already making me feel from this short amount of time really worries me (i.e. irritable at work, easily flying off the handle at people, little things bug me more than usual, etc etc).  Strike two.  Now if these feelings of irritably and aggressiveness translate into a better workout in the gym and better overall gains, I might change my review, but for now other than some extra energy this product is causing me to be pissed off more than anything else

I bought these for a glow in the dark Easter egg hunt.  Needless to say we hunted dark eggs in the dark.  They were very hard to break (had my thumbs hurting) and they were not very durable as one busted on my aunt.  You can only see a difference in the broke ones and the unbroken ones when you are in a completely dark room.  Very disappointed in this.  If I try this again I'll have to get bigger eggs and the bracelet glow sticks.

My son loved these cups. They came in fun colors.<br /><br />I loved the storage idea of the cups. After use i can stack multiple cups onto one another to take up much less room in the cabinets.<br /><br />They do not leak and have easy handles to hold onto.<br /><br />The one downside is the plastic on the zippy part is not a strong plastic and it does disform when your kid while chew on the lip.

I love these containers for homemade baby food. They clean easily in the dishwasher, and I have no problems with them in the freezer, refrigerator and microwave. The lids are tight so there is no leaking. The only problem I have is that the gaskets on the lids fall off when washing the containers. Otherwise great buy!

I really, really want to give the Lego Falcon a five star rating. It is by far my favorite ship in all the Star Wars movies, and the Lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. Also this was the first big Star Wars Lego set I bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys I dreamt of as a kid. I've since purchased six other models including the mighty Death Star.<br /><br />It really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, I can't. Why? Because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. I've read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and I don't see it. Every time I move it around, I have to be very careful. The side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. At one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and I had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. Honestly, I think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn't seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built.<br /><br />Okay, now that I said that I can get on to the good stuff.<br /><br />This is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. I spent four afternoons working on it, but that's mostly because I like taking my time putting these things together. I suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon.<br /><br />Also, as with the Lego Death Star, which I also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to Luke's Jedi training ball (even though it`s on the opposite side of the ship). The Luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. The tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these Lego sets.<br /><br />The inside of the ship is very spacious. You could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. I can't help but think the Lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like I said, they already included everything you could think of.<br /><br />Also the mini-fig selection is awesome. You get all the main characters in their classic "New Hope" outfits. Though I find the inclusion of Darth Vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the Falcon. I would have liked to see Lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in Han's absence. They could have even put him in his generals outfit from ROTJ, but it's seems as if the Lego people wanted to stick to the characters from ANH.<br /><br />A couple minor complaints before I conclude. As other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. With all the room inside the main body of the ship, I think they could have done more here. Same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. It's really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can't be accessed from the interior of the ship. It seems more like an after thought.<br /><br />Overall, I hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. It really is an awesome ship, but I just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and I think that should be noted. In spite of a few flaws, it's still very much worth it.

Cool and unique ring! My husband put it right on, he liked that he never saw a ring like this before.  It is flexible and he recommends selecting a finger that is within 1-size of the actual ring size for the best fit. The ring fits so comfortably, he forgets he is wearing it.  I purchased this ring at a reduced rate for my review and made my husband so happy.

I had no idea what to get her but I did a little searching on amazon and I found a bunch of really great, cute gifts for her age group. This is one of the gifts that I got.

Its ok. When I went to assemble the legs, I found that two of the legs had a wide crack going down the entire side. Luckily, the cracks could face the inside and out of sight. Decided not to send it back- thinking that if the legs do split into two pieces, I can superglue them back together. The top seems to fit a little too tightly to use the tray side without making a huge effort to pull the two pieces apart. I don't think it was worth the money I paid for it, and actually saw it offered at a lower price later on another site.

Ok, after a few bad products, now this is the third wheelchair I have purchased for Gracie, but finally a keeper... it is better than the first two for a few reasons. One thing is that it has a better balance than his k9 cart which the side bars on that cart bent after just a few weeks so I returned it. The other cart was from walkin wheels, it was expensive in price but cheap in design, it never worked well and broke only after a few days... We have been using this BFM cart for 2-months now and it's a good wheelchair, but I have to complain about the tread on the tires has already worn off a good bit. The company actually sent me two new tires for free, but I can only give 4-stars that the tread would wear down so quickly...

I bought my GT P1000 last year and I was very happy at first. Now that it's more than a year, I get more and more disappointed with it.<br />A month after I bought the item, 2nd gen Galaxy Tabs were released with the same price. At first I didn't feel any regret but then my GT crashes so many times the longer it's in my hands. It keeps turning off for no reason. Sometimes I just compose text and out of nowhere it reboots. Sometimes I don't use it that much then the graphics get all wrecked (I really can't tell what happens exactly but the colors somewhat distort or something) It showed during the first few months I bought it but not too often and would usually go back to normal once I reboot but now it's really becoming annoying.<br />It's also bulky and heavy not like the new ones. I just gave away my GT to my brother after a year because it annoys me too much just looking at it.<br />I liked it when I bought it and thought I made a good investment but I regret having it. I gave it three stars because the specs overall is still good but it doesn't live up to how it should.

The price seemed good and it technically worked, but it still should give you a functioning computer screen.<br /><br />The biggest issue with this is the dead pixels, tons of them appeared fairly quickly and I couldn't figure out why. I also wouldn't call the resolution anything special, I have smaller monitors that have looked better and are a few years older.<br /><br />I dealt with this performance for a little while but had to do something about it before I went crazy.<br /><br />I did some research and found a monitor that is SO much better and hasn't dropped a pixel in over two months, even though I don't expect it to ever.<br /><br />I bought it here on Amazon too ----------&#62; http://amzn.to/SHHmgn<br /><br />It is a great monitor and you won't regret using it.

I started using this glitter spray tonight before my base paint was fully dry. I decided to wait a little longer to apply the glitter. Four hours later I came back to the same bottle of glitter paint and it was clogged and would only shoot paint a few droplets at a time. I had to hold the can three inches away from my project to get the paint on and I could only apply it in globs. What a waste of money. It doesn't matter if you read the instructions, which I did and followed. The tip/applicator is not right for the paint formula.

Maybe it is me, but this thing as stretchy and pliable as it is was, was very tight fitting. Even with plenty of water-based lube it was literally chocking me. The concept and small palm size is great, but they need to make a larger version. I just could not seem to get a comfortable tug from it. I love most of the Doc products, but this one was very tight. It ended up tearing after a few attempts.

I purchased the Nero sink and get lots of oohs and ahhs over its unique styling. The color is a deep charcoal, but not black. The material seems very durable and hasn't scratched at all yet (2 months). I was a little worried that the texture of the surface (which is about the texture of the inside of an iron skillet) might hold food particles, but that hasn't really been an issue.<br /><br />My only concern is that the guidance on cleaning from the swanstone company pretty much eliminates every cleaner on the market. No bleach and no ammonia? Almost everything has at least one of these. Without either of these, you are pretty much out of choices. That said, I have found a very successful cleaning ritual. I start with  warm water/dish soap/scrubbing sponge and finish with a wipe down with a Mr Clean Magic Eraser and this seems to do a great job. I am a fan of bleach, so I do miss the sense of clean the burning odor of bleach gives, but don;t want to risk hazing up the finish.<br /><br />18 MONTH UPDATE. The finish on this sink remains flawless which I find very impressive. I have found a good cleaning routine as well. I use dish soap (e.g. Dawn) and a scrubbing sponge with very hot water most of the time. If it looks like ti needs a a little extra care, I follow that with a granite cleaner and polish. I go about 3 months between polishing and it still looks like the day I installed it.

I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head during gaming or just casual use.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it!

Now my iPad sits on my desk at the office, and pipes right into my little stereo there so my office is always filled with nice, easy listening music. I'd play Rock-n-roll, but office politics say "no harsh music". But the music I listen to are my favorite easy tunes, right off the iPad through this Dock.

It was okay. I was pleased to see that the video wasn't boring and the people on it didn't seem like robots like most exercise videos I have tried. The music was good as well. The DVD itself was very inspirational, I just think it's more than I am ready to commit to. So, I am taking points off for that. t contains 24 exercises that work on your shoulders, abs, obliques, legs, and glutes. I have no doubt that the program works, but it has to be something you're committed to. It's not something you can do for like 5 minutes a day and end up with a dancer's body. It's a satisfying, total body workout. A friend of mine used the system and she's looking amazing. I just don't have the discipline. So, if you're dedicated, then I'm sure you will look great. If it's a half-hearted attempt then there's probably another option.

A few months ago I had just gotten the PS4 and wanted a quality headset to go with it.<br /><br />My old headset was comfortable and worked well, I loved the bass you could hear with them but they weren't cutting it anymore.<br /><br />When I tried these I was definitely unhappy... The speakers would make an unbearable noise that sounded like rattling most of the time, even at lower volumes. If this wasn't bad enough, one speaker kept cutting out. I had to bang on the side to get it to start working again.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't enjoy these and can't imagine why they are charging so much for them.<br /><br />After this depressing experience I did some serious research and found a headset I absolutely LOVE.<br /><br />It's been over a month and I can't find anything to complain about. The sound and bass is great and I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort.<br /><br />I got them on Amazon actually -------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1wbUoC2<br /><br />Even if they aren't the ones for you, I hope I could help share my story with this pair.

This product really worked and was surprisingly easy to use. After researching online, I discovered that MMD's method for testing was identical to the experts.. I was quoted about 5 times as much to have someone come to my house and conduct the same testing. The report I got back from My Mold Detective was very easy to understand, too. I sent off the samples to the lab and waited three days to get results which was shorter than the local IEP's turn around time that I was quoted... I guess a week or ten days is the norm... But, sending off the samples was explained on the packaging and I double checked on the website. I rate this product 4.5 stars

I can't believe this Piece of JUNK (cleaned up for publication) is STILL being sold.  I got one after seeing it at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas (Jan. 2014).

I contacted them again.  NOTHING.  I packed up the unit and found I couldn't return it BECAUSE...they took too long to get back to me and the 30-day return window had closed.  I took SKYBELL with me this year (Jan 2015) to CES to give it back to these people IN PERSON with a few well-chosen comments...and guess what??  They didn't appear at CES this year.  If you got this POJ to work, congrats.  For me, it's a $200 mistake.

I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased the Special K Shakes after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on the Special K Shakes and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.<br /><br />If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----&#62; http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.

I am reviewing the Wubble ball on two levels:<br /><br />ONE, it's a piece of junk! I bought one at Target. I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed. Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable. NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles. &#34;Lifetime replacement warranty&#34; &#34;Do not return to the retailer.&#34; Only problem, they want $7 &#34;handling fee.&#34; BS! Plus the cost of postage to mail it back.<br /><br />TWO, As is typical, since these are only found in Target stores right now, you have a few scalpers on Amazon and eBay who buy up as many as they can at Target (causing them to sell-out quickly) and then they offer them at twice the price.<br /><br />Amazon really needs to put an end to this Third-Party rip-off activity on their website.

Rita's book have been in the market for almost 15 years now and I studied it when I took the PMP exam first time in 2007. I got busy and failed to collect 60 PDUs and recently had to sit for the exam again. I was never crazy about Rita's book but when I took the test it was my only option. This time I did a lot of research to find out the best PMP book in the market which not only will help the reader to pass the test but also help them understand real life project management with case studies and scenarios. Below is my finding:    Professor Sohel: This book is the best in every possible way. It is written in a language that anyone can understand and mostly every concept is explained with examples. It has summary tables after every topic which is simply spectacular, questions are exactly what you will see in real life exam, extremely structured and well organized. Loved this book. It's very new in the market so I don't think a lot of ppl know about it yet but I am 100% sure that this one will be the number one PMP book soon.  http://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Professional-Certification-Exam/dp/1492310549/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412381180&sr=8-1&keywords=sohel    Rita: I will consider Rita's one the second best in the market. It is some time hard to follow and digest. Questions are not as good as the first one.  Head First: I also like this book because it makes sense and easy to follow.  I think a lot of ppl will not appreciate cartoons and images in a PMP book but I liked it.  Questions are not too good but comparing others it does a good job.  http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-PMP-Jennifer-Greene/dp/1449364918/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412381221&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+pmp

I purchased this TV last month as a bedroom TV. I saw the great price and decent reviews online and decided to take a risk and purchase a TV that had mixed reviews... Boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for nearly the same price, actually $80 cheaper!.<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 40 inch TV, check this one out -----&#62; http://amzn.to/SCb3Qp it is here on Amazon. I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!

I have to admit that the design of this trunk mount rack is at least interesting. First time, I just couldn't believe that it is able to hold 2 bikes. But, yes...it does.<br />In my opinion, the greatest advantage of this trunk mount rack is that it keeps the bikes behind the car and not on top of it, so it you don't have to put too much effort when mounting the bikes. Unfortunately, some effort is required...because my wife wouldn't be able to mount them by herself.<br />The straps are a bit insecure. They could start loosen when driving at higher speeds, so you have to check them once in a while. I don't think that they will loosen completely but it's better to stay on the safer side.

I got this for my grandson.  This Teething Necklace has a different variety of shapes for them to chew on.  Which my grandson seems to love very much.  it has helped with the teething some.  The child can also play with the shapes.  This is a pretty decent product.

As one previous reviewer pointed out, the question formatting was less than optimal as the questions were at the beginning of each section and subsequently followed by the answers (hard not to cheat). Suggestion - locate the answers at the end of the chapter/text. Also, this may just be me, but the questions should come after the related section's literature not the other way around.<br /><br />Comprehensive but still lacking. When I took the exam I found myself cursing the review book as a great deal of information on the exam was never mentioned in this text. I had to reach into the deep recesses of my mind (sca ry) to retrieve some gray/foggy/probably incorrect information to answer some of the questions. Now, I know that cramming two years of full time graduate study into so many pages isn't feasible. So, I would suggest to future candidates to briefly (and I mean briefly) skim their graduate texts before dedicating majority of their time to this text.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that it was weird to have the practice questions in the beginning of each chapter, and that it doesn't give you a clear idea on how you do on the content unless you're really good at the honor system.<br /><br />What helped me the most were these 2 books<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/SPHR-Exam-Prep-Professional-Resources/dp/0789736764/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1344537422&sr=8-4&keywords=sphr<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BABSJW

&#34;I was looking to purchase a sun shade for my daughter and almost bought this one until I did a little more investigating. Since this product has over 70 5 star reviews within a matter of weeks I felt further investigation was in order.<br /><br />I researched the profiles of the reviewers and found a lot of weird &#34;coincidences&#34;. Reviewers leave nothing but 5-star ratings but what's really strange is how different reviewers review the same unrelated products and reviewers review multiple of the same type of product.<br />For example one reviewer reviewed over 20 different iphone cases within a month and all reviews talked about how great it protected their phone. Then you'll see things like 10 different weight loss bottles of Garcinia Cambodia reviewed in the same 2 week span.<br /><br />Just didn't make sense to me so I decided not to purchase this product since the reviews can obviously not be trusted.&#34;

Be sure to ask where your matcha comes from before you buy.&#34;<br /><br />It's worth checking out the article!<br /><br />BTW, the author also said that: &#34;The Japanese tea leaves did not have any tea leaves that exceeded the limit.&#34;<br /><br />I think Japanese matcha is healthier.

The lighter has some heft to it, the case is a nice brushed aluminum which is appealing... so why go through all the effort to make it sturdy and then put a plastic tip on the end to hold the igniter?!<br /><br />The tip will melt, mine made it through the original tank of gas and half of a second before it wouldn't light as the igniter tip has melted into the cap.<br /><br />Yes, the igniter needs to be insulated from the aluminum body of the lighter however silicone or a better designed tip should be a no brainier for a lighter that is $10+ dollars.

This was my first time using Chemical Guys products and I was pleasantly surprised. The cleaners work well and leave your car nice and squeaky clean. The citrus cleaner is the best cleaner, good for washing the car the day you plan to wax it. The gloss-works is best for cleaning a lightly soiled car, but does leave it wetter looking than the other washes. The big jug which I guess is a mix of the two runs right down the middle on cleaning power and gloss. The gloves are of good quality, particularly the microfiber glove. Those tend to fall apart or mold quickly here in Florida, but this one is still going strong.<br /><br />But the foam sprayer is of poor quality.<br />When this thing worked, it was great and I plan to buy another one, but will seek out a different brand. When I first got it, there was a missing part on the foamer (the hose/strainer that sucks up the soap). I called chemical guys directly to see if they would send me a replacement. They were very friendly and sent me one at no cost that arrived in only a few days. I was pretty impressed since I had actually purchased this through a third party vendor. The foamer worked like a champ for the first couple of months, but started leaking shortly after that. Then, the trigger started sticking so you couldn't stop the flow of foam. It became unusable within 6 months.

Very disappointing. The author chose not to use quotation marks which seemed weird to me, especially with so much inner dialogue. Sometime I didn't know if the main character was speaking or thinking and had to re-read in several spots.  It just seems lazy to me and I don't understand why someone would use this format. That's not why I'm giving the book 2 stars though. The author seemed to create a fairly realistic world, but then totally dropped the ball in several spots.  For instance it seemed like nearly every character spoke like a redneck. Maybe the author is implying that only the rednecks will survive... Ha ha, but I don't know. The girl, a 15 year old that can't even remember what the world was like before it all happened leads me to believe it's been at least 10 years, yet she is able to find cheese crackers on a shelf in a store. I'm pretty sure that after 10 years there would be no food on the shelf and it certainly wouldn't be eatable. She was also fortunate to find Coke in a few occasions. Never Pepsi or Dr. Pepper.  The most unrealistic thing about the book was that she was driving all over the country filling up her gas tank whenever she ran low.  I found this totally unbelievable since most gas stations would be empty after 10 hours, but here she is 10 years later.  Anyway, the story was just okay, I liked the 15 year old girl and even cheered for her. Several characters I could see clearly in my mind.  The author has talent and I enjoyed his descriptive writing style, just not the story.  I had to force myself to finish and I didn't like the ending.

Swim caps in general are a terrible contraption. They are ugly and tight and horrible. That doesn't mean I don't need one so I always look out for the best one there is. I hate the tightness of the swim cap above all. This is why I found this cap from swimculture and decided to try it out. I can't really go to the pool without a cap, because they put lots of chlorine in the waters. It's because so many people visit the pool I bet and many of them are ladies that would clog the whole place up with all the hair.<br /><br />I like this cap because it is very elastic at least. I still look just as ridiculous like all people wearing swim caps (like an alien), but at least I am more comfortable than most of them. My cap is totally smooth and sleek black, so it doesn't draw any attention. My ears and head didn't hurt at all after wearing my cap, so you can see that it is very elastic and nice to wear. If you absolutely have to wear a swim cap at least buy one that is comfortable like this one on this site.

The charging is great, the usb hub is great, the stand works great and doesn't fall over but the fans aren't exactly placed well at all. Instead of pulling the hot air out of the ps4 it blows it back in, while the console is already trying to push the hot a or out so, hot air gets trapped inside of your PlayStation and your console will overheat. My ps4 actually broke because of this reason. But if you open up the stand and flip the fans around it fixes the problem. So do not turn the fans on unless you have flipped them around or else it will ruin your PlayStation and costs $150 to send it to Sony for repairs. But aside from that it's really great and I will continue to use it once my ps4 is shipped back to me!!!

Not sure what to make of this one. I would like to believe the author, but he just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth with the ego he has. Maybe being a Dr. this is just how he sees himself.

I was sent this and [[ASIN:B00VUHJUDK another solar powered outdoor light]] and neither one managed to last longer than three days. It was a bit tricky to get this set up, but I managed to get it situated near my front door and the first evening I was amazed by it--both the motion sensor and the *sound* sensor actually worked. Loved that I could walk up to my front door, rattle my keys near it and it would just turn on. I believe that had to be the coolest feature I'd ever seen on a light. However, it was shortlived because it stopped working properly on the second night. (The other died on the third night.)<br /><br />I first noticed that the sound detection wasn't working properly, although the motion detection was. I didn't think much of it because I could live with it even without the sound detection. By the end of the week, the light stopped working entirely. To make sure it wasn't just in a bad location, I cleaned the solar panel and deliberately put it out in the sunniest location on my property I could find, and since I'm in Florida, we have no shortage of sunlight. Still, no love.<br /><br />It was great while it lasted, unfortunately it just didn't last very long.

I have had years of professional experience in testing batteries, from aerospace to hearing aid batteries. I know how to test batteries & I have the equipment. I tested these based on the standard slow 20 hour discharge rate, not a high rate which makes the batteries look even worse.<br /><br />This battery company is basically running something like a scam. I bought a total of 6 of these at 2 different times. My tests show that on average, they don't even measure up to a 1/3 of the 3000 mAh level claimed by UltraFire. One went totally dead after using only once.<br /><br />Furthermore, they only have about the same power level as found in a triple pack of AAA batteries.<br /><br />Therefore, buying these batteries makes no sense at all.

Actually the belief that "Hell is for Real" isn't a funny matter. It's devastating for many children (and adults). Most people who suffer from depression and bipolar disorder have a fixation on the idea of eternal pain.<br /><br />Fear of Hell is the price most Christians pay for accepting the promises of Jesus. You can't have one without the other. This book focuses on the culmination of Jesus' threats. There is another book that describes the lifelong affect those threats have on a young man. It serves well as counterpoint to "Hell Is for Real."<br /><br />"How to Stop Believing in Hell" is the autobiography of a very peculiar person who tries to commit the unforgivable sin to escape the threats of Jesus. In it the author describes the messes he gets into trying to rid himself of his decades long fear of Hell. The story should interest similarly peculiar people among many others.<br /><br />"How to Stop Believing in Hell" starts with a barrage of shocking blasphemies once shouted by the author at the lunch-breaking denizens of the Congressional office buildings in Washington,, D.C. After a series of adventures, the author reconciles himself with God, who delivers him from his conscience and every other vestige of morality. The author is then free to commit suicide, a fate he has longed for since childhood. In the end the happy author is "a man on a ledge enjoying the fresh air."

I never think that we can gain much knowledge from Nature until I read this book. There are such a large number of incredible lessons of how we ought to carry on with our life the way we are intended to live. It is a short book yet notwithstanding it being so concise, it has taught us the genuine significance of life. I truly like the thought that the writer introduces in his book of how human race is worried about their life and how each of us is in a rodent race, what he calls, throughout today's life. In the wake of perusing this book, I had the capacity carry on with my life at the fullest and understood the easily overlooked details that we have a tendency to overlook and pass up a major opportunity in our occupied routine are the genuine satisfaction of life.  My just concern in regards to this book is that it required about more human related illustrations and less creature related ones. Yet other than that, this book shows us the things you would not typically get the chance to learn. So 3 stars from me.

This charger worked great a couple of months. Then, it started to take a lot of time to recharge the battery to 100%. Now, after 6-7 hours my phone is just 80% recharged. At the beginning I thought that the charger itself has issues, but, when connecting the phone to my laptop, through this cable, it doesn't recharge well, either: the same problem...after 6-7 hours it stops recharging even if it has reached the level of 80%.<br />I tried to recharge my phone with a standard Samsung charger (without USB cable), and the recharge level easily gets to 100%.<br />So, in my opinion, the cable is the source of all problems.

They pop into the walls but only on on side. She didn't seem to mind that much though. I thought it was a bit strange after I finally figured out it is one-sided holes.<br /><br />The second thing about this set that sticks out is the sink that comes with it. It is cute and the idea is great and all, but it doesn't seem to have much use. My 6-yr-old daughter plays as if it isn't there. She does like the mask that came with the Little Pet Shop set. I was surprised that it actually does stay on the pet!<br /><br />The last thing about it that I have noticed - The wall mount on the bottom right (which is small cardboard) doesn't flatten out well so you can't really sit anything on it. I am unsure why they included this small &#34;surprise&#34; instead of just including a small side table or long-standing table.<br /><br />I would still recommend this to other parents but not without telling them about these things just in case.

I bought this bike headlight from another online vendor and was greatly anticipating its arrival. The light only took 2 maybe 3 days to get here but it did not work. The box itself looks like it had taken quite a beating during shipping, so this may have lead to my light not working, I can't be sure. But the online vendor I bought it from did not respond to my requests for a refund. I eventually found the manufacturer here on amazon and just as a last ditch effort sent them a message explaining my plight. To my surprise I received a phone call from a  real live human being the next day! He was extremely congenial and apologized for my recent experience and assured me I had either received a defective unit or that it was indeed damaged on its way to me. He offered to replace it with no further questions and I was really surprised - needless to say I can't rate the headlight itself yet, but I wanted to post SOMETHING now and once I get the replacement I will update my review. Kudos to a company that still displays a little old fashioned customer service.

The last GPS product from this brand worked excellent for more than 4 years but I dropped it on the floor by mistake and it has been shutting down from time to time. It's annoying to see that such a brand is producing now devices that fail to lock the GPS signal in an open field. It doesn't do this all the time, but it is certainly doing when I urgently need the device to work.

Not sure if we got a defective product or what, but after 4 sets of batteries, its now in its final resting place – the upstairs closet toy box.<br /><br />And actually thinking back now, she actually was getting frustrated by this thing, it just goes straight, and back, but when it backs up it does so at an angle, I assume to go in a different direction, THIS is the frustrating part. Unless your child is using this in a 1000 square foot room that is all hard flooring and NO furniture, and assuming you child has the patience of Gandhi, this thing will just reverse into something, then you can only go forward, which again, bangs into something else, then reverse, at an angle, and then bangs into something again, and so the cycle continues till your child will probably run over to it and turn it in the direction to go straight again, unless they have brains of an adult and actually understands how to maneuver it, which is highly unlikely. With the amount of tech out there, one has to wonder why such limited driving capacities where applied. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED.

I got this hoping to get a decent set at home but it didn't turn out that way. First, the smell of this set is nothing short of toxic. The chemical smell they come with is nauseating and fills an entire room. I tried wiping them down but it didn't seem to help and after some inspection noticed there was a warning label about the chemicals used being linked to cancer and birth defects. Also, the kit doesn't even come with enough weight to even reach 40 lbs. I weighed all the weights and they equal 38 lbs, which is with the 4 lb bar itself.<br /><br />After getting rid of these I got myself a set of dumbbells I absolutely love. I got them around a month ago and I can't find a single thing to complain about. The max weight and combination of weights included are endless. I'm so happy I bought the set.<br /><br />If you want a quality set of dumbbells, then get the same set I did here on Amazon ---------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1r0BiNN<br /><br />I hope I could help point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did!

I bought the Nautica chronograph N14536G a couple of days ago. Prompt delivery. Received the watch in good condition. The watch itself looks as good as it does on the screen... a good, solid watch... sporty looks and feel. Some might think it is heavy, which it probably is, but I have no problems there. My main complain is that the manual that comes with the watch is useless... does not have specifications/ help for this particular model. Also the seconds hand is the tiny dial at the 6 O'Clock position and the main "seconds" dial is for the stop watch, which I find weird in a watch.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a good buy, if you don't mind a heavy watch. I even got a pair of Nautica binoculars free!! And no one can beat Amazon's price.

It's a piece of junk!  My son had seen the commercials for what looked like such a fun and exciting new toy. I was thrilled to find one at Target. It ended up being such a let down....My son's spirits were as deflated as this stupid balloon.  I bought one at Target (for a fraction of the cost that people are asking on Amazon and eBay). I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed. Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable. NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles. How convenient! They include a note: "Lifetime replacement warranty" "Do not return to the retailer." Only problem, they want $7 "handling fee." Plus the cost of postage to mail it back, which ended up costing me another $5. So, that was a total of $12 to get a replacement.

My original adapter burnt out after a month and felt which really annoyed me because I had got it at a higher price compared to this one. I had to look for another one since my evenings couldn't be complete without a game or two. On viewing the advert on amazon, i read some of the reviews and finally made up my mind to go for this adapter. In a few days, i had the adapter at hand and has been well satisfied by the good work it does.

I can't believe what a piece of junk this chair turned out to be……so disappointed. I was so excited when I purchased this chair but was let down pretty fast when I opened the box. The seat was fine…..could be better quality material but I was willing to overlook that. The main thing that got me mad was that 1 of the legs was broken already! After I was given a replacement set of legs……they broke after about 3 weeks!!! I would strongly advise against this product.

I purchased this TV last month as a living room TV. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret buying it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming very quickly as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, one of the HDMI ports proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. I tried to deal with it for as long as I could but then decided this wasn't what I paid for.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for much CHEAPER!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 60 inch TV, check this one out here on Amazon -------&#62; http://amzn.to/1ozWTLS<br /><br />I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!<br /><br />If you do decide this isn't the TV for you, at least I got to share my experience with this one!

These are applied the exterior glass on your car and the manufacturer claims that they can dramatically improve you wet weather driving visibility without window wipers. Well, I don't know about dramatically but they certainly do improve the visibility through windows when wet weather driving.<br /><br />I must say I was impressed with how easy it is to install. When we had a down pour recently I hardly had to use the wipers. One thing to note however, don't put this on your side windows as I did  because you will have all the water rushing in if you crack them open for any reason.<br /><br />This even works on glass shower doors and stops them from steaming up as frequently, which reduces how often I have to clean the shower.

This product arrived looking just gorgeous. So very shiny and bright. I put my pendant piece on it, (which I purchased the chain for, BTW) and I was initially unsure whether they looked okay together, as my diamond/heart-shaped piece could not compare to the shine of the chain, INITIALLY anyway. After a few, (maybe 2-3 months) of use, the shine and sparkle quickly faded and became dull and quite frankly, embarrassing to wear. I am not usually disappointed with my jewelry from them, but this was just that, a BIG disappointment! Sorry about the review, but felt I needed to be honest; after all, I also depend on the reviews when shopping online.

My head must be a little larger than most because it didn't cover my head the way the picture shows. It fit my children's heads just fine tho.

The material used or the fabric is cotton and I like the color which is suitable for most sporty attire. I am gonna use this more specially  now that summer is almost here. It can be great protection for the face plus it looks cool for me.

I am writing this review for my wife because she is too nice. I'm nice too, just not happy.<br /><br />We've had a Paderno spiral slicer since 2012 and get great use out of it.<br />Last week we decided to buy a 2nd spiral slicer for the cabin since we are spending more time up there these days. I told my wife to buy this one because of the good reviews, especially the one from top reviewer RWM.<br />We got it and took our usual bunch of vegetables up and besides the softest ones, the Briefton was not capable enough. Just too flimsy and blades not sharp enough. Ruined our dinner and wife blamed me for choosing it of course.<br /><br />We are returning it but it really should have NEVER been ranked equal or higher than the Paderno!<br /><br />Hope his helps others from wasting their time.

I really was using this when G-oil was giving away those $20 rebates on the 5 qt jug at wally world. It works fine. I have noticed that its thicker than synthetic M-1. My mechanical oil pressure gauge runs 5-7 psi higher on this oil in my F-150 with the same 5w30 weight oil. I have also used it in my V-6 montero as well. I change my oil every 7k miles and normally I have to add 2x as much as normal synthetic (M1, syntec, Val) at 3-4k miles to get me to the 7k change. I definitely notice both my engines consuming more of this oil than normal synthetic. I am from the school of lower viscosity (higher flow oil) and less burning oil so if the price is the same I usually go somewhere else.

Most annoying, the small cover that effectively seals the spout would suction itself on once wet and when we tried to pour, water would leak around it or actually cause the lid to fly off and water to go everywhere. We even tried creating a notch in the plastic cover, but to no avail. This one with no cover obviously solves that issue. Only slightly less annoying, the carbon bits that would leak down into the main pitcher. So far, no bits. Two thumbs up.

I have been playing one of these for a while now. I love it but...  As with most hollow bodies it goes out of tune after heavy string bending leads.  This model IS MUCH MUCH better than most because of its through body solid design, which is why its called a semi-hollow body.  If you dont play bluesy bendy leads this is as good as any guitar out there. If you do. Keep a second 6 string by the stage so when you come out of that solo you are playinbg diminished chords...lmao

As I'm sure the other 6,000 reviews told you, vampires don't sparkle. Actually I'm pretty sure vampires don't exist. Nor do huge wolves which was an obvious attempt on your part to appeal to the native american people in hopes of garnishing their support in making you works reach best seller status.<br /><br />I would suggest you remove these myths from the book, which would shorten the 4 book series to one novella. In fact, if you just had Bella die from her head injury from that volleyball in gym class, we would be spared a lot of unnecessary whining and melodrama, and could go on to enjoy real cult classics like 'Vamp, the alien sex goddess masquerading as Wonder Woman.'<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />your number two and half fan,<br />TheReviewNutt

This movie has the most brutal and graphic violence you are likely to ever see. If you have any question of whether war is inhuman, see this movie to set yourself straight. It chronicles several strangers, forced to waste their lives on a pointless mission. We see how brutal and fruitless war is. The movie shows us good people and bad people (in predictable roles on both sides of the fighting). The direction and filmography are similar to Band of Brothers (for obvious reason). It is technically and visually excellent.<br /><br />The failing of the movie, I believe, is that it can't compare to The Thin Red Line in terms of message(both came out the same year). Although clearly showing that ''war is bad,'' Ryan fails to show us the underlying cause (people, even good people, are corrupt and inhuman). We see bad people do bad things, and good people do good things in this movie. See the Thin Red Line, and feel that not only is war bad, but humanity in general is brutish and terrible.

The truth is Sega hasn't couldn't escalate after Genesis. In fact, Sonic had to carry them & Nintendo was the one who made Sega popular by being their rival; which Nintendo was & STILL is light years ahead of washed up Sega so it was no comparison.<br /><br />Sega is aware of how crappy their company is cause in the 90s they swore they would never team up with Nintendo; but now they barely make just games instead of garbage systems & even team up with Nintendo so once again Nintendo would save them. The only good game in the Sonic series was Sonic 3+Sonic & Knuckles & that was just average. Sonic 1 was ok but overrated & lacks replay value, Sonic 2 was extremely easy & overrated as well, Sonic 3 was too short & a waste of time. Instead of just going ahead & releasing the full game of Sonic 3, Sega wanted to make a money grab; the other Sonic games pretty much sucked.

Got this for my daughter as one of her Christmas presents due to the fact every time me or my wife were on one of our iPads she would she (3 years old at the time, now 4) would want to play with it, since we downloaded a couple of apps for her. So I said to myself “get her something like an iPad but for kids" so I wound up getting this.  IF we didn't have any iPads, I think she would have continued to love it, but we had iPads and soon found that it wasn't an “iPad" so she still would take ours.<br />I ended up getting her an iPad Mini with an Otterbox Defender case. The Leapfrog itself is, in my opinion, not worth the price, I bought one for $170 at the time, the screen is really not that great, the resolution sucks, the games are just as expensive as Apple apps are, and though it can take a beating as she does still play with it ONCE in a while, spend the extra cash and get an iPad mini with a VERY good case, and child proof it with passwords, the leapfrog is very child friendly in terms of them not being able to access the internet, only a “special" internet, that was the only real plus.

I have to say, I'm fairly disappointed in this book. First, it reads like an essay written by a high school student; the author is clearly not a writer, and I'm surprised it made it to publication in this format. Secondly, it spends a significant portion of time singing the praises of  The Caring Pregnancy Center, in Minnesota. That place has been caught on film telling scared, pregnant young women that abortion can lead to breast cancer. It's shameful to promote an organization that lies to girls to promote its anti-woman agenda. While the information on deaf history and culture in the U.S. is interesting, I would not recommend this book to others.

I sprained my ankle a few weeks ago and this helped keep the swelling down until I could get home and treat it with my warrior mist pain spray [[ASIN:B00A347MD6 Warrior Mist Pain Reliever + FREE Vivazen Pain Killer Shot]].<br /><br />Our whole softball team has bought these and everybody we play against always wants to use them and know where we got them from.

Although it the cord states a 2 yr warranty, I noticed that there is a very short return window on Amazon.

Bought two of these last month. They're thinner than the two I bought two summers ago. These two don't cut the heat or sun exposure much. You'll still need sunscreen and sunglasses when sitting under them. Also, I wish the description had mentioned that the poles are black; they look tacky with the beige stands I'd bought for the previous two (which had beige poles).<br />If you're looking for umbrellas that give true sun and heat protection, these aren't it.

I can say that this camera isn't the best when it comes to durability because after 3.5 years of service, my 7D just stopped working. I don't know why, I treated it like a baby since it's my first DSLR. Now I don't know what to do, it's already out of warranty and might be costly if I send it to Canon for repair. I had 60K actuation and it never fail me before, but know this happened and don't know what to do. I tried all known methods/tricks to give back it's power but nothing worked.<br /><br />This camera can give you the level of pixels you expect for 18MP and the fast performance when it comes to focusing. However, you should know that you also need a good lens to get sharp images, trust me. Use prime lenses. they're tact sharp. zoom lenses have sweet spots but when you use prime lens you'll get what you want!<br /><br />If you really want a DSLR that will last I think you should change your mind and get an inexpensive model instead and just invest in lenses. DSLRs have a life span and you'll regret if you spend a lot of money on a full frame or a semi pro DSLRs and after 3+ years it will be dead and unusable. I've been there, trust me.

What can I say. It is a good paddle for the price that I paid. The contour of the paddles look great. The shaft is a little smaller than others, but does not seem to hurt the performance of it.

Yes it does looks lovely in photo right? But how does it actually look when you bought it? Let me point out a few things why some of us here are disappointed about this product.<br />- The color of the pillow stains with each other so it really gives this BEAUTIFUL daybed a huge mess<br />- The cushion covers are sewn backwards. Yes, backyards, so as a result, it doesn't look good.<br />- Colors easily fade! It doesn't look good after a few weeks of use or a month or more, so it is really disappointing.<br />- It's not easy to clean unlike the other daybeds out there. The cushions are really hard to remove and as I've said, colors fade and stain other cloth.<br />Overall, it's really annoying. Not worth the money.

I think the watch is really pretty and looks so beautiful and gold. Um, only thing that disappointed me about this watch is it did not come in a box! :( lol It was wrapped in bubble wrap. I wanted it to come in a box because I was buying it as a gift for my aunt and everyone knows I can't give her a watch without a box! It will look used. :) Anyways.. I talked with the sellers about that concern I had and they were very understanding and dealt with me very patiently, prompt and professional. So, "Lovers2009" are indeed excellent sellers to deal with when you have concerns.<br /><br />This all being said, the watch does NOT look cheap in anyway and is so worth the 6 bucks, it is such a steal for the look. I received it ticking and in great condition. Oh and one last thing worth mentioning if I were to use it, it did not fit on my wrist. Keep in mind your wrist size, I would say this is for women with big wrists. Sorry girls, unless you want to scoot the watch up like on your arm to let it fit. I hope my review is helpful. Thanks!

This is the coolest wallet I've ever owned in my entire life. It's comfortably thin, has pockets for cards, and water proof. I kept my first one in my back pocket for over a year  before it started unraveling on me. I tried taping it back together, but that didn't work out too well. Well, at least now I can get another design without having to feel too guilty about it. If you're looking for a wallet that'll last you a lifetime, this is not it. But if you're looking for something that'll make people ooh and ahh while it lasts, then get this awesome wallet.

Ended up buying one of these because it was the only one available at the store and I needed one in a hurry for a shoot the next day.  You get what you pay for, basically.  It's lightweight, but feels cheap...head movement is minimal and any attempt to swivel will result in some severe choppiness.  I felt like I was going to break it most of the time while using it, which isn't the best feeling when you're working with expensive equipment on top.

Not good. Get a pair of these instead. http://www.amzn.gift/B004WZVO68/  Just for the record, I'm not your typical jaded 'beats hater', largely (well probably solely) because I didn't plunk down my own hard-earned cash on these expecting to be blown away. I simply had a bunch of Macy's store credit and gift cards with no better place to go than on some new cans. I figured they would be disappointing but passable and that's exactly what they are.  I hope this review was helpful!

My daughter always gets pretty cool, nice gifts from her friends at birthday parties and we’re always trying to put together even better gift bags for her guests than before. We’ve found all types of cool little things to add here on Amazon and we ordered a whole lot of these bracelets for her last birthday party. We order two colors of this style so that the kids could layer them if they wanted. They seemed to be a huge hit and although they’re cheap, it doesn’t seem like anyone had an issue making it last!

I bought this unit for my family because:<br />- it was very attractive and low profile so it could sit in on our kitchen area desk and be very unobtrusive<br />- I wanted good quality photo prints on the occasions that I did those things<br />- I wanted good quality scans<br /><br />On all accounts above it looked and worked great.<br /><br />I also used it wirelessly on a reserved ip address (where it would always boot to that address), and again it was mostly flawless on that account.<br /><br />Now for THE BIG DOWNSIDES:<br />- ink is super expensive for daily printing of our kid's reports, etc and the cartridges are insultingly small in small capacity and large in cost<br />- constantly annoyed at always having to go back to the "advanced" dialog menu to change printing from color (expensive) to black and white (can't seem to make black and white default stick - I wonder why!)<br />- can only use Epson $$$ cartridges (electronically keyed or something as opposed to my old brother mfc-j630w that you can fill with generic ink once you buy the  refillable cartridges)<br />- I still ended up with problems only using the expensive Epson ink ordered directly from them (problems not initially, but later) when my perfectly fine original manufacturer cartridges stopped working (print gaps) even though they were almost new, and then in head cleaning or alignment to try and get a cartridge working again it would often tell me it no longer recognized some of the other cartridges that had previously be reported as near full, and that were previously printing fine, but now suddenly the printer had a problem with them?!<br /><br />In the end I wasted far too much of my time (and anguish) trying to get this thing to print again.<br /><br />My advice : stay away from this model (and probably this brand), because even when you buy, buy, buy into their eco-system, you could still end up with the problems I had, and waste a whole lot of money, your time, and get a lot of frustration trying to fix some unfixable problems.<br /><br />Threw the whole unit into the garbage, and went back to using my old brother mfc-j630w, which I got back up and working in less than 30 min.<br /><br />Sure the brother doesn't scan as well, doesn't look as nice, and doesn't quite print photos as well, but when I want to print something, it darned well prints, and quickly as opposed to that frustrating slow and often flaky Epson (that worked so nicely at the beginning and then became a demon).<br /><br />Now I'm happily printing on command, and much, much, more cheaply using my brother.<br /><br />Glad to be done with the Epson demon.<br /><br />Don't think I'm some industry person writing a negative review - I'm a real guy, who is pretty darn technically competent, but I'm just sick of wasting my time and energy on stuff that doesn't work - and I really, really wanted to Epson to work on many accounts, but finally just gave up and threw away a frustratingly unusable piece of gear (and a fair amount of money in gear and unusable cartridges).

Bought this as a gift for my niece and he really loved it. I don't know what's the basis of these boards but it looks like it is made from a high quality rubber and plastics.

Something about this monitor just seemed cool, so I ordered it excitedly since it was such a great price. I don't know if it has anything to do with being USB powered, but I was not happy in any way...<br /><br />The screen resolution compared to other monitors I have used just seemed off and ugly. Additionally, some of the pixels seemed to stop working.

This is not what I was expecting. I was hoping this would be a lot thicker since I live in the mid-west. Instead it is super thin and almost see through. The stitching on this item is not so good. It started fraying only after a day my sone wore it. It does have the look in the picture, I will say that, but it is so thin, that this is purely something for fashion and far from warmth from the cold.

I really contemplated getting this headset for a while due to the high price, but finally gave in a got a pair. Sadly, they didn't perform anywhere close to as well as I hoped.<br /><br />I hoped they would be comfortable on my head and over my ears but they weren't at all. I could barely use them for an hour, which was weird having never had that issue before.<br /><br />I don't consider myself an expert, but the sound was pretty sub-par. Some of these reviews are hard to believe, as if they were talking about an entirely different headset than I tried.<br /><br />After the depressing performance by these, I researched as much as possible and finally found a headset I was VERY happy with.<br /><br />Great sound and comfort, which is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />If you need a great set, check out these here on Amazon ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1lvdMGE<br /><br />Even if you don't give them a try, I'm glad I could help share my story with this set!

It might be cool to some buyers, but I don't think so.  You buy a well designed, functional bib from the product design aspect and safety consideration of your baby, and not mainly for its "cute" appearance and certainly not for the bragging (those are adult parent's superficial wants out of the baby bib, and not for the considerations of the baby).     Just looking cute won't cut it. Safety precaution should always come first for your babies!  THIS BIB CAN BE A SERIOUS HEALTH HAZZARD when little Johnny gets a little too curious with that locking button.  He might want to try it out himself and chokes the helpless little one from behind when mom is too busy and not watching.  I am sorry; this is a major design flaw: The overall design concept using a locking button on a baby's neck is a BIG NO-NO!! It is unsettling thinking about the potential danger. I will not be too surprised when the child safety and consumer protection agencies are knocking on the door. I will not use it. Shall I say it has "too many strings attached" for me to consider.

Received an item returned from a previous customer and not fully inspected before sent to me? The installation kit plastic bag was cut open so screws were all over the place when I opened the package. Also, one of the two screws in the middle of the bar which were supposed to hold the extension mechanism inside the bar was popped out right out of the box. It took me half an hour to put that screw back in to place so I can properly extend the bar to fit the door.

I approached this movie with huge anticipation.  The director, Jee-woon Kim, has directed some PHENOMENAL Korean movies.  The cinematography in his movies I Saw the Devil and The Good, The Bad, and the Weird is simply some of the best cinematography I've seen in any movie anywhere (American movies included).  If you don't mind subtitles (and you shouldn't) check both of those out.<br /><br />So I was excited that Mr. Kim's American debut was going to be Arnold's return to the big screen.  The previews looked promising and fun.  But something about the movie just felt...off.  None of the action sequences were all that impressive or original, and you certainly don't go buying a movie like this for the plot and characters.  it also seemed like some of the risks and insane cinematography that the director had shown in some of his previous movies was absent.<br /><br />Overall, it's not bad, but if you really want to be entertained, check out the aforementioned Korean movies by Jee-woon Kim.

I have a D800 which I do not want to lug around when we are just going out for a simple day of fun. The settings are very Nikon and once you fine tune all of the settings the camera will take nice quality images. Much better than my iPhone 5 that is horrible indoors. My only complaint is that the processing from photo to photo is a tad slow, but I'm used to my DSLR so I did not ding it for that. I like Nikon quality and this is perfect for the family to mess with and for the price I am not very worried if it gets banged up a bit. My favorite feature is that it takes normal AA batteries... that is a great feature.

3.75 overall<br /><br />I started watching with no real knowledge of how BBC intended to interpret the legend though I guess I might have been expecting a more historically accurate look and tone (meaning darker and grittier) because that has been the trend with historical movies since Gladiator back in 2000, and you can see it now in stuff like Spartacus and Game of Thrones. Don't come to this Robin Hood series expecting that.<br /><br />In this first few episodes, the story is set up with some dark touches with the people starving, and King Richard's taxes bleeding everyone dry for the Crusades, and people facing penalties like getting their hand cut off for poaching in the Sherwood Forest. A soldier back from the Crusades has a moment of mental anguish from PTSD from his combat experiences. And Robin feels guilt when it looks like he might not be able to protect his "peasants" from the Sheriff. So, the serious stuff starts to get emotionally involving.<br /><br />But then there is far more of the cheesy, unbelievable archery stunts and swashbuckling. Everyone looks startlingly 21st century as in clean, scrubbed, well-fed, moussed and gelled, and fitted into the best, tailored costumes from the Props Department. Probably the most unbelievable character is the Sheriff of Nottingham, a total buffoon who mocks the heroes by making faces and mouthing their words in a snide tone like a five year-old. It is hard to believe that he has the competence to hold a position of authority and be a threat. In one scene, and I am not kidding, he rolls his eyes and says, "Well, yippee."<br /><br />So, is this comic satire then? Stuff that you're not emotionally involved in at all? Well, there are those serious moments I mentioned, so the tone kind of lurches back and forth, at least for me. Jonas Armstrong is a little bit lightweight as Robin Hood, but he alternates nicely between twinkly kindness and some quiet moments of stern outrage. But Richard Armitage in black leather - oh,my god - is total intimidating hotness as the Sheriff's main thug Guy de Gisbourne, and he steals every scene with his glowering eyes and gravelly voice. I may keep watching just for him.<br /><br />Overall, I think this Robin Hood series is enjoyable as a cheeky adventure meant for broad family appeal. If you get impatient with historical stories that are not historically believable, you might want to stay away.<br /><br />Edited to add: I have now watched every episode of all three seasons, and have come to a much greater appreciation of the villains who really steal the scenes. The Sheriff won me over with his hilarious lines and demeanor. Actors Keith Allen (the Sheriff) and Richard Armitage (the Sheriff's henchman Guy of Gisbourne) are so good they almost seem to be improvising with each other in scenes to add little details of personality. The character of Much remains a delight and Allan A Dale gets a terrific subplot that plays up to his lovable con man personality.<br /><br />I would give seasons 1 and 2 a four-star rating. Season 3 gives more intricate costumes to the main characters (nice). It also gives Robin a haircut to make him look more macho than mousy (still not possible) and gives Gisbourne long hair so he looks like some kind of death-metal god (I liked him better with short hair but, seriously, man, the actor is so beautiful he can rock any look). The reasons I wouldn't give season 3 four stars is the inclusion of two really annoying new characters: the shrill and brassy Kate and the pompous and pushy Friar Tuck who declaims every single one of his lines as if it is a matter of the gravest importance. Also the fact that the less-than-compelling Robin is the only actor in all the episodes of season 3. Gisborne is absent from two and the Sheriff is absent from four or five. But I loved the guy who shows up to play Prince John for three episodes as a narcissistic creep, and I also appreciated the devious and complex new character of Isabella.

How this has 4 star rating is beyond me. My WIFE even had to hide this "game” from our daughter. We love playing games with her, but this thing, wow, thank God it was a gift, made it that much easier throwing it out in the middle of the night. First off, that Styrofoam contraption they show and make look like its stands perfect is way off, the Styrofoam, I assume, from being curled up in the box, retains some of that memory, there for it never stands like it should and was always falling over, very awkward. Then the actual game came, which was very boring and tedious. Save your money, give a bond or something useful to your child or if gifting.

This product seemed like it would be fine as my husband and I put it together. It only was missing two washers so we weren't too worried. The next day after it was all set up I went to use it. It was smooth and felt just like any other elliptical I have used. I did notice a bit of resistance when I was on it for about 20 minutes. I just assumed, &#34;well it's new maybe it has to be used a couple more times.&#34; Definitely wrong. Went to use the very next day, (don't forget, two days after setting up, one time of use!) and was completely annoyed to notice that something had to be grinding on the belt inside because I could barely move the pedals forward to get going. So we take that apart and peek inside and sure enough the darn belt looked as though it was about to come right off and was ripping. We called customer service at weslo and they proceeded to tell us that item is &#34;really backordered &#34; and we probably should take back to store. Thankfully we kept reciept and box for item. Seriously, don't waste your time or money with this product. Its a joke.

As an amateur, the price of the DNA5050 thrilled me. After getting it, I had a change of heart with my purchase. Don't get me wrong, I think that it's great. The truth is, it  didn't really fit my needs but the price sold me. It's way cheaper than another stabiliser of similar make that I've been eyeing for a while and I guess it was an impulse buy.<br /><br />In any case, there's nothing wrong with it. I spent a few weeks getting to know this Glide Gear stabiliser--I particularly enjoyed the easy release mounting plate--but in the end, it was not for me (my cameras are on the smaller and lighter side of basic, most often used is a Sony pj200 camcorder) and carrying the 5050 for teeny tiny cameras just felt and looked stupid. I ended up trading it with a friend for oddly enough another Glide Gear product (the DNA1000), which had come out later.<br /><br />So all things considered, it was still a great purchase. I avoided wasting and losing out on an impulse buy, got a great stabiliser along with a few other things that matched well with my cameras, and I bagged a lot of good will too.

The TV version of the Flash wasn't great; BUT it was the best adaptation to date for TV of a hero and came about during an era when comics were just starting to be recognized as a mature medium. On that scale, some of the plots here were a little hoky or campy and some of the Villains, too -- but the Flash of DC comics really didn't get serious and dark until its final initial run. John Wesley Shipp wasn't visually ideal as Barry Allan but he did a great job with some occasionally campy material as did an array of guest stars. Modern effects made it possible to bring the Flash convincingly to life, and it's well worth watching for any DC fans.

They are easy to assemble once you get the first one done and get the hang of it but as said in previous reviews the lighting gives off a blue cast :( I look gray and blue and not well lit at all :( ALSO, I walk by them and just the wind from my body knocks them onto the ground, they are very flimsy and you would need to purchase sand bags as well as the lights in order to keep them standing up which is a big disappointment.

The authors of Hell or Heaven seem to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see it as a book at all.<br /><br />In "How to Stop Believing in Hell" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the Divinity of Christ, the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading.

I purchased the DVD based off of all the instagram photos and celebrity transformations I have saw. Overall I like the DVD. The workouts are simple enough to do. You will sweat. A tip I recommend is to always put more into each set that you do for better/quicker results. I love how the mother engages you by being active through EVERY single workout. She pushes you to finish.<br /><br />As far as the daughter's workouts, very &#34;squaty.&#34; That's pretty much all she does, besides give instructions on what you should be doing instead of demonstrating. I love all the leg workouts she does in her segment, and I really love all the Ab workouts. I really don't watch her anymore, but I use the other lady in the back, Christy. She does everything. As she pushes, I push.<br /><br />Complaints: The low audio quality. The sound is drowned out by the background and my the music. You have to turn up the DVD to a higher than normal level to hear what is being said. Also there is some issue with the transitions into forms with Lana's portion.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, you DO NOT have to follow the meal plan associated with the DVD. I used my own regular foods, at a lower rate than I would normally do. I just eat smaller portions, and eat more (wise food choices) frequently. I can tell a huge difference in just one week of working out. You have to have SOME sort of diet or discipline. Just because you workout, does not mean you will lose weight, you must also watch you intake.<br /><br />Good luck ladies. You can follow me on IG if you like @XIjaneiX

I got this camera as a replacement for an older SLR that I had from a few years ago. I wanted something great without going too crazy and spending too much. The first main issue I ran into was the fact that the auto focus system. I then noticed after looking around on the internet that it's a common issue with this model. Only about 1 in 10 pictures were taken correctly due to this focusing issue. I had tried every setting and adjustment but the problem still remained. Also, it would randomly shut off during use for no apparent reason. I just wasn't happy with the camera.<br /><br />I then did some research for a different model that I could be more confident buying so that I would be happy with it's performance during use. Luckily, I did find a way better camera and finally don't have to deal with the annoying issues the 70D had. Nearly every picture I take focuses correctly and stays on during use like it should.<br /><br />If you want a great camera, check out the same one I got here on Amazon ---------------&#62; http://amzn.to/WBF8So<br /><br />I hope I was able to help point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did!

I should have listened to all of the reviews I read about how this product does not pair well with the iPhone 5. Instead, I was captivated by the look and sound of the Pill and ignored the reviews, thinking they were all posted by anti Apple people. I was wrong.<br /><br />DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!!<br /><br />The Beats Pill is easy to pair with the iPhone and the sound is great. However, after 40-45 min, the connection breaks and the music stops. At first I thought it was a wifi problem or a problem with my phone app (Pandora). But, after repairing my iPhone 5 the problem continued. I switched to iTunes and had the same problem - the connection kept breaking. I used my son's iPhone 5 and had the exact same problem.<br /><br />I visited the Apple store (where they sell this item) and asked if they knew of any problems. Their reply - - "We haven't heard of any problems and haven't had any returns". Really? I find that hard to believe.<br /><br />I returned the Pill and purchased the JamBox and have NEVER had a problem with the pairing. Sure, the sound was better from the Beats Pill and the look is definitely more appealing. But, I am not getting rid of my iPhone.<br /><br />I am an Apple person and own iPads, iPhones, iPods, and MacBooks. So my review is not anti Apple. This item does not stay paired with the iPhone 5. If you own one, DO NOT purchase the Beats Pill.

It is not clear what this book is intended to accomplish. It is a compilation of mathematical knowledge aimlessly stacked in an oversized book. The book is entitled Geometry but it covers most aspects of mathematics. The Elements and the Structure of geometry are not Set Theory. Of course a geometric object could be interpreted by the set theory, but geometry is not set theory nor is set theory geometry. This is as good as saying physics is mathematics. Interpreting a line as an infinite set of points denies the very essence of what is a line. Geometric object are visualization of physical things and it has rooms in our mind, infinity is a pure abstract philosophy of mathematics and has no room in our imagination. I do not recommend the book for learning a curriculum. It would be a good reference on the bookshelves.

[[VIDEOID:20708eb37a950de547970bfed8c2f9e]] This trimmer works wonders when it comes to trimmingh my Cockapoo. Normally I have a really hard time trimming him and this really seems to do a good job. My only complaint with this is, periodically, I have to stop during the trim, remove the attachment, and get the fur that is stuck. I am not sure if it is just my dog or what. It soesn't happen often but it certainly does. I love how this comes with a brush to clean up the blades. There are two different attachments included with two sides. Each side offers a different length. If you are looking for a quality pet trimmer, I would recommend this one.    This item was provided free for the purpose of inspection and review.

If you are reading this review prior to buying and installing the product, do this RIGHT NOW - buy a 14 mm tap with a thread pitch of 1.5. My husband has worked on all of our cars for years. He is also a mechanical engineer. When we read all the reviews about it being a tight fit, we thought those people were being dodo birds.<br /><br />We put our 2009 Acura MDX up on car ramps and my husband struggled for two hours on a Friday night before giving up. There is too much build up to install this hitch without thoroughly cleaning all the gunk off and using the tap in the bolt holes under the vehicle. We thought we would get a tap on Saturday and get it installed. "How hard would it be to find a 14 mm tap? We live in the Seattle are so it shouldn't be a problem," we thought. Oh. How. Wrong. We. Were. Places like Ace Hardware and Shucks Auto do not carry a tap that large in-store. They were special orders only. After calling a few friends out of desperation, we were referred to Tacoma Screw in Seattle and they had one. Machine shops are not open in the weekends, so that's why we had trouble getting one. It took five hours to track one down.<br /><br />Once my husband used the tap on all the holes, the hitch went right on. It was still a snug fit, but he didn't have to struggle.<br /><br />We have been using the hitch for about a month now. It looks good on the car and didn't require a special bumper trim piece. We are happy with the hitch itself and have used it to attach our Yakima Holdup bike rack.<br /><br />I also recommend buying the hitch cap if ordering the hitch from Amazon. It was under four bucks and gives the hitch a more polished look when not in use.<br /><br />The hitch arrived from Amazon on a Friday instead of Monday as Amazon estimated a three days sooner than expected. It was packaged in the original Curt box. It was supported nicely in the cardboard box and the hitch was wrapped to prevent scratches. The hitch was in pristine condition.<br /><br />This hitch would have gotten 5 stars, but I feel like there should be a recommendation from the manufacturer to have the tap on hand when you start, thus only 4 stars.

The amount of times this thing glitched and froze is beyond possible to count. This thing gets super hot during use, much hotter than is safe for use I would say. You can't even watch Youtube videos on it...<br /><br />I thought it might be a good idea since it was a good deal but I was wrong. I have a hard time believing any positive review about this product because there is nothing good about it.<br /><br />The screen hardly registers your fingers and when it does is calibrated way off of center.<br /><br />Don't waste your time and money and get a decent tablet I did.

2 Guns was a fun movie that I am certain to watch again.  It is a gritty CIA/DEA/Mil-Intel/Crime Thriller based around bank robbery money, drugs, and a Mexican drug lord.  While I find it silly that men can get shot in one scene and fight and stuff in the next, this was based on a comic book story, which I am sure had "superhero-ish" characters.  The comic aspect does not come through in the movie though, which was good. I recommend this one to ALL cop and military action/thriller fans. Great acting carries a "comic book" plot that has more twists than a roller coaster! 4 stars - MR

I was excited when this product finally arrived.  After so many raving reviews, I was looking forward to putting this peeler to work in my kitchen,  But I was very disappointed when I opened the box.  The stainless steel finish on the handle was all pitted and scratched and did not look anywhere near as good as on the product photo.  But worst of all was when I tried to make zoodles.  The blade flew of the peeler on the first slice and I ended up cutting myself.  It looks like the blade was not even attached to the peeler.  This was a poorly manufactured peeler and I am left wondering why this product has so many 5 star reviews.  Into the trash it went.

It looks beautiful and seems perfect for a woman like me who holds too much accessories. The color is gorgeous, I love how they colored it up. So many compartments which is what I like most and that lock feature for the top and side part is genius. I also love how they maximise the space it have, like the side compartment for necklaces, it have this small pockets at the bottom and still have hangers. Downside was, the box I received have some flaws and I blame the Quality Control inspector here. Some of the hangers are not properly attached, they are somewhat loose. The inside compartment of one of the drawers isn't aligned properly like the others so it has this uneven area. Mirror isn't clean when I opened it, I don't know how it happened. Next time, I hope they inspect these kind of things first before sending it to their buyers.

Shopping for a camera can be overwhelming when you take into consideration all the mixed reviews about point-and shoot cameras. So, I decided to purchase one that was small to keep from wasting too much money on a camera that would not produce. After all, most of the rave reviews are given to very large and expensive cameras.  It was time to see if a mini camera could produce what it promised, and I felt like I had nothing to lose.<br /><br />This pocket camera proved to be an excellent choice. It has excellent shutter speed, very fast recovery in between shots, 10x zoom capability, low light capability, macro capibility, and nice video quality. In other words, it does exactly what you'd expect a "point-and-shoot" camera to do: take great pictures.<br /><br />However, it doesn't work well with the flash, and it has a very dark quality when recording video in low light. If you can handle using small flush buttons and going through multiple menu items to erase a picture or toggle between manual and automatic pictures, then it's worth your while.  After all, anyone wanting a compact camera is not asking for professional photography.  You just want something that's easy to carry that will also take good pictures.  This camera hits the mark.

These look beautiful on the website and are good quality.  The color was wonderful, and they fit true to size.  In fact even with the very high heel, they are comfortable.  Unfortunately for me, the platform was so high that I felt it took away from the very lovely shape and look of the shoe, and took away from the attractive look of the the shoes when you are wearing them.  If you like big platforms, then you will find this a very nice shoe, that will be comfortable to wear.

I have these for months. About a week ago I started noticing that I have audio only in one ear. But the mono ear experience jumps between the right and the left depending on the way I hold and wiggle the wire. And as the days go by, it has gotten worse.

But then emailed them to change it to a 20 in. I got an email back saying theyd do it and that they sent in my request. I just got it yesterday and it sits on my neck its so short, but i dont have the time to return it. So other than the fact that the company straight up lied to me. Its a beautiful necklace.

Ink is such a ripoff, but especially this kind. I hate HP ink! And let me tell you WHY! Because the crap hardly lasts and it's a complete ripoff. ALL of these people that wrote these five star reviews must either work for HP or SMOKE CRACK IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS. No one in their right mind would say they enjoy paying $20 OR MORE for something that probably costs less than $.50 to make (probably more like $.10 even after handling costs) and that can't even print out a short novel, or heck, a children's story for that matter.<br /><br />To the reviewer that said this black ink cartridge lasts 220 pages YOU ARE A FLAT-OUT LIAR AND/OR A MORON, and neither should be writing reviews and giving untruthful info to other people. The only way this ink would last 220 pages is if each page had a single word printed on it or maybe a single sentence. Maybe even a short paragraph. But no way in hell would one of these cartridges last 220 full pages. NO WAY, NO WAY, NO F-ING WAY. I do my own personal taxes, the taxes for my parents, and taxes for my own business. I print two copies of every return, one for my records and one for sending in (I don't e-file). I printed 38 pages this year, 2014. Let me spell that out for you: T-H-I-R-T-Y E-I-G-H-T P-A-G-E-S...And that's it! The ink is GONE. R-I-P-O-F-F<br /><br />I don't know what the solution is for this BS printer and ink problem we have right now, but I know it's NOT buying these HP cartridges because they suck!

I bought these boots for my job as a privet security company. I do a lot of standing and needed a boot that breathes. I am giving these boots 4/5 stars due to a very rough and hard leather sole but all you need is a nice insole and you are set. They support your feet and for my preference it's perfect it might be different for other people but I was told you want good hard support. Just having a gel sole will ware and start to hurt. With these they cup your heal comfortably and have two vent holes on the inside portion of the boots. So in short I recommend these highly and I would advise you to buy dr.sholes or somthing to that effect because the boot offers you the support in which it should and the insole you buy is just the icing on the cake.

Visually, the earrings are beautiful. The stones catch the light and sparkle like they are expensive. But when you actually have to manuver the lever & put them on, the metal is very flimsy. Will easily bend the wrong way. You must be extremely careful with them. Also the overall earring is small when you hold it in your hands. Almost a little too small and delicate for an adult. The size is more appropriate for a tween going to a special occasion.

This is heavily advertised on television but it is heavy for what it is and it is not sharp enough to open a can or envelope or to be used as a box opener.  The screwdrivers and wrenches are very limited and are also clumsy and hard to use.  The rulers work fine, but that's about it.<br /><br />The corners are sharp and will wear a hole in your wallet.<br /><br />You cannot fly with this, the TSA will confiscate it, there is no TSA approval for any kind of particular pocket tool like this.  Don't argue with them, or you won't fly.<br /><br />The price is also outrageous.  It probably costs fifty cents to make.

My reviews on Amazon are usually very enthusiastic for the product I'm writing it for, but this magsafe adapter is horrible-- (oh yeah, and would spark and smoke). I do not abuse the wiring and my laptop stays mostly on my desk, except for the few times it moves to my bed or the couch; I rarely take it out of the home. Yes it sucks but what's the alternative? Get the expensive apple version? Look at those reviews! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B002TLTIS8  This time I used duct tape around the magsafe part up to a few inches to prevent the wire bending. Hopefully this helps and actually makes this POS have a life span of more than three months.   The new one is supposed to be flush with the laptop to theoretically cause less bending, but instead it spins around and around until the wiring shorts out. Of course each time I noticed it coiled I would fix it and try to straighten out the wiring, but after a few months of this, the wiring just completely quits conducting electricity.  It's absolutely ridiculous that I have to spend close to a $100 dollars every couple of months! I really could NOT care less how &#34;thin&#34; and &#34;stylish&#34; it is-- I want it to work AND for a respectable amount of time.  In summary, I love Apple, I have all their products, including the iPad, but their wiring (including the usb connections) really need new engineering. I guess go with this one http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B002TLTIS8

I read some reviews warning about lead contamination in Chinese Matcha. I read up on the issue. I found that lead contamination is certainly a big problem with Chinese matcha. Research done in 2006 by Han and his associates at the Key Laboratory of the Ministry Of China called &#34;SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA&#34; reported that 32% of 1225 samples of Chinese tea exceeded the MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE CONCENTRATION of LEAD!!! It is a real danger that we all should be aware of. Another study has shown that even organic green tea from China contains lead!!!<br /><br />Lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen, 1999). I understand that the contaminated water enters agricultural soil in water irrigation systems which obtain water from the river. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a definite risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!!!<br /><br />Interestingly, this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is much better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was &#34;not measurable&#34;<br />Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), nervous system (including the brain) and bones!!!<br /><br />The way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. In 2013, ConsumerLab.com advised people NOT TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until they are sure about the purity of the matcha!!!<br /><br />It says in the CUSTOMER QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS section that uVernal told a customer called Barbara Zaretsky that uVernal matcha is made in China. As lead contamination is a big problem in Chinese matcha, I believe that the actual laboratory report should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the uVernal so that we can all read the results and get some PEACE OF MIND! Until then, I am NOT AT ALL HAPPY to drink this Chinese matcha. Once I see the laboratory report uploaded on Amazon, I'll write more about this product.

I've had this wind deflector for over a year now. Now, this deflector does block wind, but don't expect wonders here. The deflector reduces the wind when you drive, but not by alot. This deflector is a minor help.<br /><br />My only other beef is the deflector has started to yellow a bit. Perhaps being left out in the florida sun is too much, but the deflector has lost a bit of its original clarity. It reminds me of the first wash of a white t-shirt. By the time you wash it the 12th time, that white T-shirt is now taupe.<br /><br />I will say the deflector looks great otherwise, and I got a response to my email in hours, and that was cool.

A lot of people don't like this drink and it kind of feels like I'm piling on and joining the herd, but I can't help it, I don't like it either. I feel bad for the Gold Kili people, but they've got other drinks and maybe all these reviews from people who don't like it will help them to decide to focus their attention on those.

Love the feel, quality and even care instructions...no bleach wipes on this baby. But, can be drying cleaned - wow! I like that...will have to update all after my first dry-cleaning experience. For now, I have a 3 piece handbag, wallet and tote all in coordinating designs. Looking forward to an up-coming trip so I can put all these fashionable pieces to good use. It has caught my eye...and it's going to stay with this designer for a long time!!!

This is a basic entry level flute; I didn't expect it to be professional quality. I was short for time because my daughter needed it ASAP. I found this one here and figured I would go for it only because shipping time was shorter than other stores. Shipping was on time and flute plays as it should. Flute is priced almost more than same brand at other websites. If you're not in a hurry buy the lowest price flute from other stores and you will be getting the same brand name as this one...

I ordered 2 for my 9 & 7 year old girls. I planned on having them monogrammed with their names. The Zipper is locked on these. I even tried to tug with pliers - could not even break the lock? I don't know if they are crimped on the zipper pull but it will not budge. I can live with that! What I can't live with is that After 3 or 4 months these beanbags are flat as a pancake! You guessed it...... I can't add any stuffing. Its been so long now I own 2 BIG FLAT UGLY chairs. I gave 2 stars because the material is sturdy and so is the zipper. Color was nice too! Thanks

FOR THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED- I DON'T READ HATE COMMENTS, I WILL REPORT & BLOCK YOU ASAP SO HAVE FUN REPLYING TO YOURSELVES & ENJOY YOUR STUPIDITY LOL<br /><br />The Greatest player ever? LOL Umm no. That award goes to JORDAN! Hakeem is the BEST center ever! This is a boring & misguided documentary. If Olajuwon, Ewing, Duncan, Robinson, Sabonis, Mutombo, Daugherty, Mourning, Divac, Smits, Shaq, etc heck even Yao was playing back in the Chamberlain & Russel days, when NBA was fractured & wasn't fully established- no 3 in the key, no shot clock violation, no 3 pointer, etc, only a few teams, the average height of a player was around 6'3,only a few Black players, etc. they could have average 50 ppg, 20 rpg, had 11 rings & scored 100 points. I laugh at the idiots who are comparing NBA in the 50s-70s to NBA from 80's til today. Wilt & Russel wouldn't stand a chance against PF & C that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Jordan said it himself that Hakeem is better than Russel, Kareem, & Wilt & stated that he will take Hakeem over any Center in NBA history & I agree. No Center in NBA history is more quick, agile, better shot blocker, the ONLY C that's top 10 in steals, better footwork & had better post moves than Hakeem regardless who you think his better. Can you honestly say if Russel & Chamberlain would have came in the late 80s & 90s when NBA was at it's peak at defense, PF & C position do you think he would have 11 rings & scored 100 points? People need get over the fact that NBA is 100 times more competitive than it was in the 50's-70's ESPECIALLY in the 90s. FACT IS NO NBA PLAYER HAS NOR WILL EVER HAVE THE IMPACT AND INFLUENCE ON NBA IN ALL ASPECTS THAN JORDAN

I hadn't purchased a new camera in over 5 years. I really needed a new one and I though the good reviews on here would point me in the right direction. Now, I don't see how any of them are real...<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that the pictures looked no where near 16.1 MP quality. They were grainy and very low quality. At first I thought it might be the settings but it was always that way no matter what I did!<br /><br />If that wasn't bad a enough the time it took to scroll through the menu was super slow. It was painful and I dreaded having to do anything with it. I thought for the price, I would have received something better.<br /><br />I could only deal with this for so long, so I got something different after doing plenty of research. I spent hours looking for something I could be confident that I would like.<br /><br />After owning the new camera for a month I can say I have used it pretty much every day. I love it! I can't find a thing to complain about and it hasn't taken a bad picture yet!<br /><br />I got it here on Amazon in fact ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1okZUPV<br /><br />I hope it helps anyone that needs to know what will get them the best camera for the money spent!

I do not recommend buying this! Out of the entire box, 5 pieces, small ones I might add are good quality the rest are horrible.  The worst piece of all and of course the biggest is about 3x4x12 with a large knot running through the center, length wise, and a face that is actually bark about 0.5in thick.  If I wanted wood like this I would go to a wood pile... not pay for it expecting at least good quality blanks. I don't know what idiot "hand picked" this selection but he is no lumber expert as the description implies.

Another Obvious Knock-off of Original 5-Star McPolo's BabySoft Bib    This brave seller doesn't seem to care if he is violating any copyrights or infringing on any trademark and patent protections. He is not even weary about offering a knock-off product of the highly acclaimed McPolo's BabySoft Bib, a quality product at Amazon most parents are aware of. Not only that, he just casually "drives through all the red lights" so to speak and "borrows" their product images puts on his own logo and calls them his own! Sorry it is what it is, this is stealing under broad daylight! More to that, the language he uses to describe the product is also just too obvious a copy from the originator's version, as if he does not have any imagination, enthusiasm or beliefs pushing his knock-off product, but just wants sales, sales and more sales. One more thing that I cannot swallow, and it is the final nail to the coffin: He even brave enough to "borrows" McPolo's customers' product reviews next door on Amazon, word-for-word and fabricates the entire customer reviews entries!! I give him a 5-star for his guts!! But I cannot stomach and condone blatant business misconduct in such a way under Amazon's nose. I wonder why they don't take actions against this seller, to be honest. Sorry, I will not buy this product at any price. Fair competition is ok, but this is just too much, too much in-your-face, unethical and it is totally un-American.

Whoever designed the remote control sleep mode feature needs to be fired. What were they thinking? How can you train a dog when the remote goes into sleep mode after a minute? I have to push and hold the button of the remote to wake it up for few seconds before I could correct the dog and most of the time it's already too late as the dog is already done misbehaving. So unless your dog needs correction every minute, the collar will not be ready when you need to correct a behavior. This is such a waste of time.

BEWARE of LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE MATCHA!!! Last year ConsumerLab.com (a leading provider of consumer information and independent evaluations of products that affect health and nutrition) said that it is NOT ADVISABLE TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha!!! The only way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. I would like to see the actual laboratory report on lead content of matchaDNA Chinese Matcha. It should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the matchaDNA so that we can all see the results. Once I see the laboratory report on Amazon, I will decide whether or not to drink this Chinese matcha.<br /><br />I believe that lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China. Subsequently, contaminated water gets into the agricultural soil via water irrigation systems which obtain water from the River Yangtze. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a real risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!<br /><br />I was happy to read that this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was &#34;below the measurable limit&#34; :)<br /><br />The reason why we should all check the amount of lead in Chinese matcha before drinking it is that Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the BRAIN (causing learning and behavioural problems), heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), and the bones! It is important that we see the lab report. It is a food safety issue!!

I am reviewing the Wubble ball on two levels:<br /><br />ONE, it's a piece of junk!  I bought one at Target.  I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed.  Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable.  NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles.  &#34;Lifetime replacement warranty&#34;  &#34;Do not return to the retailer.&#34;  Only problem, they want $7 &#34;handling fee.&#34;  BS!  Plus the cost of postage to mail it back.<br /><br />TWO, As is typical, since these are only found in Target stores right now, you have a few scalpers on Amazon and eBay who buy up as many as they can at Target (causing them to sell-out quickly) and then they offer them at twice the price.<br /><br />Amazon really needs to put an end to this Third-Party rip-off activity on their website.  It really degrades the whole shopping experience.

Cello prices are very expensive in the DC area string shops, and many of them are Chinese made (professionally set-up).  My daughter's school orchestra teacher told us she needed to move up from her 1/2 (used) cello and I thought about the quest to find an affordable ($650) first cello for her, we actually drove hours to another state and had to puchase a bow.  If my child was a serious string player who practiced and played for the love of the instrument then I could see spending the money for the 3/4, however my child doesn't practice consistently and this isn't a full sized instrument.<br /><br />The sound isn't as good as my child's 1/2, more muffled than clear, no ringing end notes.  We replaced the strings with pro-arte brand strings and noticed enhancement in the sound.  Good, not great sound enhancement.  The E string broke while the adult &#34;helper&#34; was tuning in chamber orchestra, the pegs are stiff and tricky like most new string instruments.<br /><br />Tip, don't purchase the more expensive perlon core style (dominant) strings with this beast.<br /><br /> I then purchased the prelude strings in the red package, now we are talking.  I had forgotten my own lesson with the first cello after we had first purchased it, get the heavy duty strings that last for students (and helpers) who are still learning to tune.  The sound is brighter with the new red pack of strings, you can hear the cello, especially since most students get the cheap strings that are &#34;brighter&#34; sounding for their violins that tend to drown out the few cellos.<br /><br />The bridge is very thick and appears to be carved from a 2x4, however it gets the job done with little finesse.<br /><br />Price is the selling point for this cello.  The price is right and it is able play after easy set up.  Sound is deep and mellow.<br /><br />***I strenuously suggest getting better strings!, the ones included are more fishing line than cello strings.

It says in the advert &#34;100% USDA organic&#34; but there is NO USDA ORGANIC LOGO on the PACK! The USDA labeling regulations for organic food products state clearly that the USDA organic symbol must be displayed on the pack if a product claims to be USDA certified organic. ‘Accelerated Intelligence Distribution' (the distributors of matchaDNA) also claim in the advert that the matcha is “USDA, SWISS, EU and NOP certified organic”. Again, there are no symbols or evidence on the pack to support their claim (there should be evidence on the pack)! The distributors are MISLEADING customers into thinking that the product is certified organic by two organic certification bodies. Why would you not print the symbols of the organic certification bodies when the regulations say you must? No one is above the law. I think that this is a scam. This is totally unacceptable and unlawful! This gift has to go in the bin!

I bought this about ten months ago, we used it a lot last summer. It rusted within a month of getting it. I painted it with high heat paint and it still rusted all the way through within two more months. Wish I would have spent another fifty and got a better quality one because this year I have to buy another. Not cheap if you have to buy one every year.

The very first complaint I have is that you cannot secure the zone wires to the controller with any reliability .  They are push connectors and not screw on.  Second the customer support people do not know the product.<br /><br />You cannot skip zones when you have the all zone remote programmed.  In other words you cannot say do all zones skipping the empty ones.  That means that the pump has to run.  I guess if you had a system that did not need a pump you would just time through the zone with no connection and everything would be ok.<br /><br />I am tearing out the system and putting a rain bird system in that has a better range to the remote.  I am on 1 acre property and the unit does not reach 300 feet.<br /><br />Consider purchasing quality and you will not have the headaches I have had.

This camera came as a huge disappointment to me. This is not a good camera. My 11 year old 2 Megapixel Canon IXUS produces much better result. This camera is only good if you are in bright daylight. Even then the pictures are so grainy. Don't be fooled by its appearance, the touch screen is useless, non responsive and non functional. Its unnecessarily complicated.

Overall I just wasn't happy and felt guilty for buying it.<br /><br />I dealt with that ordeal and then did some research to find a pool that my kids would enjoy and would show up in good condition. Luckily I found a great pool here on Amazon and have never been happier with it.

After Skyrim was released, it was really popular. I wanted to try it since a lot of people I know recommended it. Most of the stories were betrayal of people and there was always a twist in the quests that's why I loved the game. The graphics is great too and there are mods if you want better textures but for me, it's already fine the way it is. I have it in my PC with my graphic card Radeon 5570 and the game works just fine and I was really happy when it was released in PS3 since I could see better visuals of the game. The game didn't disappoint me and I'm really happy with it. The only thing that bothered me was that there were bugs and I really hate updating. Still, the wait was worth the game. It just got harder for me to adjust to its controls since I'm used to using keyboard and mouse for this game. Still, its epicness is worth the wait. Great graphics, great story.

I had a old Vito from the '80s one child is using and is as good as new minus a little cork on the mouth piece.  Still works and plays nice.  Plastic is in great condition.<br /><br />Another child wanted to learn the clarinet so we picked this instrument up.  It works, plays fine.  Good for a student to learn on.  Good price.  The only problem was the mouth piece was not smooth at the top where the reed sits and your mouth touches.  We picked up another mouth piece and that fixed the problem.  Child was able to play without hurting their mouth anymore.<br /><br />That said, comparing my old Vito with this instrument really shows the difference in manufacturing practices, for the worse.  The Vitto was a student instrument and it looks so good compared to this brand.  The Vito is easier to play.  You don't need to force as much air through to get a good, clear tone.  The tone of this clarinet is deeper, need to adjust mouth and breath to get be in tune with electric tuner teacher uses.  Not a noticeable problem unless you have another clarinet to compare against.<br /><br />If you aren't certain your child will stick with this instrument, go for it.<br />Beginner, go for it,then upgrade as they advance.  Better instruments do make a difference in sound.

Also, the griffons scene made it look like they could've just used that the whole time. Another thing that people might not have liked this is the fact that it only built up for the following movies.<br /><br />My suggestion for people who have not watched is to either watch it now and wait for the next movies or watch it when the next movie comes out. But for me, I suggest you guys just watch it especially if you are a LOTR fan.

We bought this model just last year and up till now we enjoy that HD quality it delivers. Simply fabulous! Every inch, hair, wrinkle, make up, teeth stains on the actors/actresses face can be seen without a doubt that it is what we thought it would be. As for the SMART option of Samsung it is also great but sadly it sometimes lag? We don't know if it's just the TV or it's our network having problems. Other than that, the only con I can tell everyone here is that one sickness thing Samsung Smart TV's have - the auto restart/shutdown thing. We've been experiencing this at random times so we can't tell anyone here how long it would restart and such. We reported it to Samsung and they told us that we're not the only ones having the same problem. We updated everything and checked every settings. Eventually, the restarting thing wears off and like nothing happened. Still, we experience restarts but with it happens rarely now.

However, the volume coming from the speakers was very faint. I tried to tweak the settings and also adjust the volume at my home theater receiver for the rear channels.

This is false advertising.  First when I tested the levels 3 to 15 it produced no shock. I didn't think that this was a big deal because my dog is only 25 lbs. When I had to use it on my dog it yelped and started shaking with level 1.  I then hooked up a multi-meter and check the amps and voltage output and found out that levels 1-100 all produced the same level of very strong shock.  So I went online ang googling and see if I'm doing something wrong and the search point me straight to some Youtube videos.  I have found out the 100 levels advertised are not really 100 levels but 100 different frequencies so that the remote won't interfere with other radio frequencies so basically this collar has only 1 level of very strong shock.  Upon further reading the other reviews, I see 1 buyer also had the same complaint that the collar has only 1 level of strong shock.  To me this is a very dangerous collar that could hurt your dog.  Please buy at your own risk.  I will be returning this collar and get the Petsafe brand at my local pet store.

I couldn't have been more lucky to buy this jump start pack when I did. I have a Ford Escape and I just recently (after a series of unfortunate, but fortunate events) found out that my battery needs replaced. I was very thankful that I had this portable jump starter in my trunk to help me get through the day. Not only did I have to use this once, but twice within the same day without any indication that the charge was wearing out. When I finally returned home after the day I wanted to see just how long the charge lasted... so I charged my laptop as well. All of the product details are very accurate. This product saved me from an extremely stressful work day!

I got this as a living room television, hoping it would be decent quality and would last a few years at least. Sadly, that wasn't gonna happen.<br /><br />When using one of the HDMI ports, the picture was very fuzzy and nothing seemed to fix that. Also, the picture quality was worse than the TV I was replacing from 5 years ago! All around I was surprised at the good reviews it got and let alone confused.<br /><br />This was so hard for me, after spending so much money and to be worse off than I was before.<br /><br />After I dealt with returning this TV and researching as much as possible I found a GREAT 50 inch TV that hasn't given me a single issue in any way.<br /><br />If you want to take a look, it is here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/1vi1LHp<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the TV for you, at least I got to share my experience with this one.

I already have a really nice expensive air compressor with cables built in so I wanted this to be a backup if for any reason I ran into issues with my model. I took them out of the package when they arrived to play around with them a bit and they are a bit flimsy and somewhat smaller than what I was expecting, but at this price point I'm not all that surprised. In any case, they're sitting in my trunk now in the case that I need to use them one day. Not bad though, glad I got them!

We tried it with our cat, and it might be because the first hole or two were too big, but he refused to use it. He used it before we cut the hole, but refused to use it after we cut the first hole. On top of that, the hole we cut was only half the size of the first hole they have marked on the plastic and it still didn't work. The plastic itself is very flimsey.

I have a fairly remote access point for my WiFi. I had purchased this subwoofer kit to set up some active speakers on my balcony. Even though this product is called subwoofer kit, it is actually a full-frequency audio link. After reading the positive reviews I gave it a try.<br /><br />Unfortunately it turns out that no matter where I place either of the wireless units, as soon as the receiver links up with the transmitter, my WiFi is gone. No more access to the AP. Bummer.

This really can't be used for much more than soldering two wires together. Anything much larger or heavier and it just wants to fall forward especially when you use the magnifying glass. The weight of the glass alone almost makes it tip forward. Although the clip arms are adjustable in about any configuration known to man, that almost makes it worse. With so many possible directions to turn or move the arms, it's hard to tell what part needs tightned to prevent it from slipping.

This is the first guitar I ever picked up so I had nothing else to go by. I thought it was greatest thing. I thought it made me look super cool too. A few years later and some more experience and I still think it's a great little guitar. I'd advise anyone buying it new now to change out the strings. It has good sound and won't let you down. You really can not pick a better guitar to learn on. I have a great fondness for my first.

My husband and son are always playing this and occasionally I play too I personally like Modern warfare a million times better than this one. The maps on this game are so big and yet I still end up spawning with enemies behind me. I will say that it has nice graphics, but even still it lags and graphics aren't the only thing that matter when playing a game. With the maps being as big as they are they should allow a lot more players. We are all hoping that the new one will be better than this one.

We purchased this F/X speaker as an option for rear speakers for our living room. The setup was pretty straightforward. The user manual that comes with the speakers is pretty self-explanatory. So that wasn't the problem. Unfortunately, every time someone uses the Internet in our house, the speakers would drop the sound. We tried changing frequency of wireless router but the speakers still don't work reliably. They typically work for less than one minute before dropping the audio for a few seconds. This is really annoying. I had some high hopes given that the speakers were made by a brand-name manufacturer.

I bought one of these bulbs at lowest just to try it out. I tried this thing in four different lamps in my house. In two lamps that are on/off fixtures, it worked very well, providing even light on the top and bottom of the lamp with no flicker or hum. In the two lamps that have dimmers built in, the bulb flickered and hummed horribly. You could hear it humming throughout the entire room, and the flicker was like a strobe light. Even when the lamp was set to full brightness, the flickering and humming did not stop. I do not recommend these for anything with a dimmer!

I got this camera hoping to get something I wouldn't have to upgrade for years. I had tons of plans for it and couldn't wait to get it and start using it. Sadly, I wasn't able to do what I wanted and expected with it due to two main issues. First, just about 9 out of 10 shots I took, the pictures didn't focus correctly. I thought I was doing something wrong but come to find out, many people have had this same issue when I researched it online. Also, during use the camera would randomly turn off without any warning what so ever.<br /><br />After dealing with the issues I had enough and did some research to find a camera I knew I wouldn't have an issue with. Luckily, I found a great camera that I absolutely love. Every picture comes out nearly perfect and I love the way the interface is set up, much more user friendly. I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over month of using it as much as possible.<br /><br />If you want a great camera that you can count on, get the same one I did here on Amazon --------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1oapQK7<br /><br />I hope I'm able to keep others from making the same mistake I did and get the better camera in the first place!

I jumped the gun on this 4K TV, yes, the picture is pretty, yes, its got a fancy look to it, but when it all boils down to it, its just a “higher" definition TV that you barely notice a difference after a while, I bought mine in Best Buy and side by side you can see the difference when compared to a 1080P set, but once home and set up, its meh.<br />For the price I paid I could have bought 3 1080P LEDs TVs but had to have the new stuff first. I halt from giving it 5 stars due to the price and what it really is capable of so far, in terms of 4K content, which for the time being, is pretty much non existant, but hey, I got bragging rights!

Great 5-Star Product but An Obvious knock-off of the Original McPolo's BabySoft Bib<br /><br />This brave seller doesn't seem to care if he is violating any copyrights or infringing on any trademark and patent protections. He is not even weary about offering a knock-off product of the highly acclaimed McPolo's BabySoft Bib, a quality product at Amazon most parents are aware of. Not only that, he just casually "drives through all the red lights" so to speak and "borrows" their product images puts on his own logo and calls them his own! Sorry it is what it is, this is stealing under broad daylight! More to that, the language he uses to describe the product is also just too obvious a copy from the originator's version, as if he does not have any imagination, enthusiasm or beliefs pushing his knock-off product, but just wants sales, sales and more sales. One more thing that I cannot swallow, and it is the final nail to the coffin: He even brave enough to "borrows" McPolo's customers' product reviews next door on Amazon, word-for-word and fabricates the entire customer reviews entries!! I give him a 5-star for his guts!! But I cannot stomach and condone blatant business misconduct in such a way under Amazon's nose. I wonder why they don't take actions against this seller, to be honest. Sorry, I will not buy this product at any price. Fair competition is ok, but this is just too much, too much in-your-face, unethical and it is totally un-American.

This is a great looking watch for its price. That is the top and bottom, the watch is fairly thick which you don't notice from pictures. the sides also look like cheap plastic. The band is good looking but very stiff, lucky i got a Russian mechanical watch with a good band but always runs fast, and that was the reason for buying this one. Also when I got it, it didn't move after i wound it up so i thought it was broken. But when it fell on the ground and i tapped it, started moving. All in all, it has a great look just a little thick(more then a cm)

After weeks of not seeing any ants in the traps despite ants running around the kitchen, I was perplexed. Well, I just found out why. I went downstairs and saw 2 large ants &#34;trapped&#34; in the liquid food reservoir, trying with all their might to escape the trap. I thought the trap was finally working, but when I revisited the trap 15 minutes later, they were gone. The trap was again antless.<br /><br />These &#34;traps&#34; are great at attracting ants, but they have a fatal flaw--they can't keep the ants from escaping.<br /><br />Either Pennsylvania has super strong mutant ants, or these are just poorly designed traps.

I wish this thing had a more refined user experience but other than that it's awesome. It's nothing like the Boxee or Apple TV, even as much as it looks like one. It loads right into the android desktop. If you've ever used an Android tablet then you're right at home. I've got mine plugged into the Ethernet. Plugged it in and it got an IP address and off to play without any problems. Takes a little getting used to if you've never used Android before. Lots of resources on the internet. Great forum on their support site. Customer support is AMAZING. They answered a ton of questions before and after I purchased it. I feel confident in buying it. It's a little glitchy here and there but I think they'll have this perfected with software updates in no time.

I purchased the first edition Octomask and was quite pleased with the performance of the mask. However the design I was not a big fan of. So when I saw this product I decided what the hell; same company and much nicer look.<br />That was a BIG MISTAKE.<br />This mask leak water slowly through the two side (until you get to about under 20 feet were the pressure pushes enough on it to make it stop leaking) On top of this I emailed the owner after he told me to and then ended up on a MAILING LIST! I got Octomask mail now 1 sometimes 2 times a week. Thank God for the Spam Filter.<br />I am going to be sticking with the original for now and making sure never to give my email out again to another amazon merchant.

Title says it all... You can do much better as far as sound quality for far less money. They have decent bass, stylish looks, fair build quality, but simply are not the headphones for serious listeners.<br />They performed pretty good on hip-hop, but if you are into anything else, and expect $200 worth of sound, these fall way short. In fact for half the money, you can get a set of Sennheisers that out perform these hands down.<br />In my opinion they are simply a name brand fashion accessory and not a performance headphone. Guess it boils down to:<br /><br />Are you looking for great sounding headphones? - these are not it. They get points for style, and bass performance is solid.<br />Mids and upper frequencies are muddy and lack luster. They simply fall flat for most music.<br /><br />Are you looking for a fashion accessory and don't really care much for sound over looks and branding? These are your headphones. They do look nice, are fairly comfortable for semi-long wear. They have a solid ( but boomy ) bass response, but really.... At $200, they are just over priced bling.<br /><br />To each their own, I think if people were honest, they couldn't possibly justify the price to performance, had they actually listened to some good headphones. Or perhaps they just need to attempt a justification for spending $200 on these, but bottom line is: if you want performance, sound quality, build quality, and maybey not so much the looks and the branding. You can do much much better in a set of Grados or Sennheisers. If you just want ridiculous bass you can get the Klipsch for $50 less and they sound just as good, if not better. I can't tell ya what you like, but I know good sound... And you may have noticed I didn't mention several other over priced branded headphones that I seen others mention. Basically for all the same reasons... You can do a lot better for a lot less money. But even if you decided to buy a $200-$300 set of Grados or Sennheisers, you are gonna get what you paid for, and they will completely destroy the branded price equivalent.<br /><br />That's my opinion : )

This TV show aired the 1st 3 seasons.  The 4th season was filmed, but never aired on TV.  I'm going to sit on the sidelines & wait until this is done RIGHT, meaning all 4 seasons + some EXTRAS become available as a SET  I didn't know about this show until the beginning of the 3rd season, which means I've never seen the 1st 2 seasons.  A "season" consisted of only 13 episodes.  I'm unwilling to buy this piece meal.....meaning 1 season at a time.

Not a good substitute for a window unit and definitely not a good replacement from central. With the weak cooling output, I'm surprised this is anything more than a 9K or 10K btu, it simply does not cool a room even after 12 hours of operation. It also fills up with condensation fast, be prepared to empty every 4-5 hours or it will completely stop cooling. The window kit that comes with this is a disaster. It takes a lot of effort and duct tape to keep it fixed. I wonder how many people have wasted hours installing this unit. A very poor excuse for an air conditioner. "

There are so many negative reviews, and now I understand why. At first, it seemed light, easy-to-use, and a decent product. Then it kept getting wrapped around the shaft.

I purchased this TV last month as a bedroom TV. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy!

For the price these are not bad, and don't get me wrong they work great. The only problem that i had is that the parts that go around your ear don't go completely around, they kind of sit on top of your ears and are a little bit tight. The plastic isn't very giving so it makes them a little tight around your head. Other than that, considering the low price they work well. Although if you are looking for headphones similar to "turtle beach" these aren't what you want.

This chess set is junk. The seller claims the pieces are "solid" and "filled", but no - they're each hollow, flimsy and embarrassing. You can blow them over easier than blowing out a birthday candle! The weight of the pieces is about 14 ounces so each piece must be about 1/4 of an ounce. A shabby production all around, as hollow as the claim that these chessmen are in any way standard. By "value" I suppose the this means cheesy. Even the board is nasty and smells funny, but we were able to salvage it after we aired it out for a few weeks. Unfortunately you won't be able to do anything about the cheap hollowed out pieces.

I purchased two of these and two of them arrived in a timely manner with more than adequate packaging. I put some Celestion Silver series speakers in there, I found that adding speakers to the cabinets really boosted the performance of them as sound enablers. Only complaint would be the hardware, the screws were too skinny for the speakers I had and the sinks for said screws were screwed on instead of sunk into the wood. Maybe there was a reason for that, I'm not a wood/screw/screw sink guy. I've used them at a couple of shows now and have wound up standing on one of them on more than one occasion because hey rock and roll I'll stay up past 10pm, I don't care. Reasonably priced and functional, plenty of speaker cable in place in addition to an easy install for the speakers (I wound up using the hardware from my old cabinet, though).<br /><br />No gypsy curses detected, so A+ in that category.

It ended up being such a let down....My son's spirits were as deflated as this stupid balloon.<br />I bought one at Target (for a fraction of the cost that people are asking on Amazon and eBay). I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed. Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable. NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles.  How convenient!  They include a note: &#34;Lifetime replacement warranty&#34; &#34;Do not return to the retailer.&#34; Only problem, they want $7 &#34;handling fee.&#34; Plus the cost of postage to mail it back, which ended up costing me another $5.  So, that was a total of $12 to get a replacement.

I don't want to be super mean, but I feel like I have to express how disappointed I was with this product when it finally came. I put a few pairs of clothes in it, along with some expensive equipment. When I went to pull it out of the car? It all fell out. I mean onto hard cement. My I-pad actually broke, and the warranty just expired. I'm going to have to pass on recommending this to others.

Giving it 2 stars due to my daughter at one point loving it, what kid doesn't like a tent? But after the exhausting processes of figuring out how it is supposed to set up (directions are horrible) you come to find out that this baby aint coming back down. Why? Is it possible? Yes… if you have absolutely nothing better to do than untwisting all the ties you made up. Trust me, get something that just "pops up” without the tedious hassle of this thing. Oh, did I mention? Its now a main stay in the corner of her bedroom, just sitting there, on a good side note, its nice to throw her toys in if you have to and make the room look clean should you have to in a rush.

Really wanted to like it, cause I think a videogame set in Chicago sounds AWESOME.  Unfortunately, the Chicago in this game is a weird not-really-Chicago.  Like there are mountains in this Chicago.  Among other things.<br /><br />That's a quibble, though, if the game had been super fun to play, I wouldn't have cared.  But so far (and I'm not QUITE finished with it), it's kind of a trudge.  Lot of similar mission types, lot of very loose driving, and a lot of very loose combat.  Loose is a generally good term for the game overall.<br /><br />Since it seems like this'll probably get a sequel one way or another, I'm hoping they can take all the cool fun things out of this one (THE HACKING) and polish them into something really good the next time around.  Worth it at 20-25 bucks tops, probably.

This game is/was a gigantic let down. The game is fun the 1st time through.. but after that, it's boring and monotonous. Blizzard clearly showed that they were more focused on creating a Real Money Auction House than a good, enjoyable game.<br /><br />I got this game for the enjoyment of dungeon crawling, but unfortunately, this game doesn't have it. And the itemization is beyond awful. I also purchased this game in anticipation of arena/pvp. But with the induction of the RM-AH, it's essentially just going to be a "pay2win" form of pvp.<br /><br />One thing that was particularly painful for me was the fact that when you 1st play the game, you can only play it in Normal difficulty. Beating the game on Normal unlocks the next difficulty, and so on and so forth. This is beyond stupid and was done just to keep people logging time in the game. Normal difficulty is a joke. It's dumb that Blizzard forces you into playing it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a dungeon crawler that's actually focused on "fun" and "gameplay".. buy Torchlight 2.

My only complaint with this expensive costume is that people can see your underwear is they are NOT the same exact yellow as the costume. I suspect that the one I got may not be original since it was way below the average selling price, came from overseas, and the seller didn't have strong feedback ratings. Returning it is also painful because I have to cover the shipping back to Japan. I have seem another listing for this product which seems to be better but I don't want to keep expending time-money.

First, I bought this through digital purchase on the Blizzard website, but I think getting as much negative press out there to prevent more gamers from falling for this ponzi scheme is important.<br /><br />Warning: If you purchase this game, you are willingly becoming a human node to farm profit for Blizzard. The game is designed completely around the need for the real-money auction house to compete and do well in the end-game. The difficulty curve in the final stages of the game is so absurd and the loot system is so obscenely weighted against you in terms of probabilities to actually receive an upgrade, that you have no choice but to farm for hours on end to afford to purchase upgrades from the auction house. This game could have been named: "The World of Auctions" and it would have at least not been as big a let down as slapping the Diablo franchise on the front of the box.<br /><br />One month into the game, Blizzard releases the real money auction house. Now the auction house that uses the in-game currency (Gold) is a barren wasteland of good loot. It's meh-mediocre at best. Anything very good to great gets slapped on the Real-money auction house for 25 bucks or more, sometimes 250 bucks. It's ridiculous. But here's where Blizzard's greed starts to shine through. They get $1 for every successful Real-money auction. So there's no incentive for them to fix their broken game experience. They'll just sit back and watch desperate people trying to squeeze an ounce of fun out of their game by spending their real income on virtual garbage. Did a champion pack with aggravating affixes just demolish you repeatedly? Why not spend 5 bucks on this amulet to improve your chances?<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the real-money auction earnings either dump directly into a blizzard balance that you have to spend in their digital store, or you can transfer it through paypal to your account. Paypal takes their cut, and I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard owns some part ofPaypal through subsidiaries.<br /><br />Soon, even the in-game currency will be available for purchase through their real-money auction house. They couldn't figure out how to make a game that the Chinese wouldn't farm and sell virtual goods in, so they just embraced it, and now they're going to get their cut at least.<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor, go play something else. This game is nothing but a money grab in a somewhat pretty looking but poorly developed gaming experience.

I purchased this TV last month as a bedroom TV.

Next, one of the HDMI ports proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again.

I can't say that I was impressed by this. I liked the look but when I got to test it out, it couldn't even pass the sitting test. No matter anyone who sat in the chair, they all said it was too slippery and you couldn't actually stay in the chair unless you stressed out your legs. Aside from that, the chair has weak legs and they weren't balanced well. One of them even cracked and I think this is just a cheap chair that looks good, but it's totally not worth the money. Even the oldest chairs are tougher than this one.

I got this desk to replace my desk that was getting too small for my dual monitor setup and other office items, but I didn't end up getting what I was looking for. The first thing I didn't like was that there is no leg room. I'm not the tallest person, but I felt like a giant sitting at this desk. After a few weeks it began falling apart piece by piece and the glass started not to fit well and would shift around. Overall I just wasn't happy in any way with it.<br /><br />I dealt with that for a while and then did some research and found a desk that I love now. I fit well sitting at it and it is sturdy as can be. I've used it for over a month now and can't find a single thing to complain about!<br /><br />If you want a quality desk that you will love, get the same one I did here on Amazon -----------&#62; http://amzn.to/UbOUIU<br /><br />I hope I was able to point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did!

Packaging was perfect, set up was very easy, sound was just OK.  I say that because I wanted the system to make the sound of my TV much better.  The sub woofer and back speakers do not seem to active unless the system is receiving a 5.1 system.  On Comcast cable system most if not all of the audio is stereo.  Thus the front sound bar is working but no the sub.  I called the factory and they were extremely helpful but told me that was the case.  I like the wireless speakers and probably will keep the system however it did disappoint me.

This should be described as a toy. I don't know why it's listed in the instrument section of Amazon. As a guitar, this is useless. I was hoping to teach my boy how to play on it, but instead he just strums away on a piece of junk that I can't tune no matter how hard I try. And even if I can get it tuned, it might stay there for ten minutes tops. Disappointing, and falsely advertised.

I was sent this and [[ASIN:B00VUHJUDK another solar powered outdoor light]] and neither one managed to last longer than three days. When I first pulled it from its packaging, I was surprised at how small it was, but I decided to follow the directions and get it set up. Then the first evening rolled around and it illuminated my entire front porch, much stronger than another outdoor light I'd been using, and the motion detection worked very well. I was amazed beyond words and I was so thrilled that first night that the next morning, I moved my previous outdoor light and put this one up instead.<br /><br />Day three rolls around and I noticed one evening when I went out that the light didn't work. (The other light died on the second day.) I thought that was odd. Then on the fourth day, I noticed that the light would come on around dusk--not unusual--and the motion detection would work as expected, but a few hours later, dead. For some strange reason, it seems the battery doesn't seem to be holding a charge, which is odd considering I live in Florida, we have no shortage of sunlight here, and this is placed in location that receives direct sunlight for nearly 10+ hours a day. I even tried cleaning off the solar panel, but still no joy. So, yeah, it still works, but only for a few hours each night and by the time it's fully dark out, it's useless.<br /><br />I've since moved my previous outdoor light back and although it's not as bright as this one, it's still going strong all night through.

I don't usually get into arguments like this because it's impossible to deal with irrational folk who<br /><br />think they understand a subject just because some paid off “scientists" confirmed their bias. But<br /><br />I have to say something because apparently this is being treated as a fact-based documentary. It's not. It's propaganda for right-wing sheep to bleet and fall over. The overwhelming majority of scientists know -- they don't believe nor do they feel -- they KNOW that climate change is fact.<br /><br />If anyone has a science degree here and has evidence to the contrary, feel free to contradict that. Unless this documentary and the so-called “scientists" involved in it has the support of over 97% of actual scientists as is the case with supporting the reality of global warming, I call complete BS on this film. Again, if you have a science degree that makes you an expert on this issue, feel free to contradict the overwhelming majority. Go ahead, I DARE YOU...

I was really excited about this filter because it looks nearly identical to the Renovo Trio but its a few buck cheaper. Its cheaper because they don't package it properly and because they are selling my contact information and they are using questionable marketing tactics.  First, the packaging; this filter has an activated carbon filter in it. Anyone that knows anything about filtration (air or water) knows that activated carbon MUST BE SEALED. The activated carbon is sensitive enough that it will absorb pollutants in the air and wear out. So, as the filter sits in their warehouse the activated carbon is being used up which means it will have questionable efficacy when you really need it. My filter showed up in a cheap box with a sticker on it. These should be sealed at the factory. I placed mine in a vacuum sealed bag when I got it so hopefully there is still some life left. Being curious as to what I might expect in terms of shelf life, I checked their website and was surprised to find very little technical documentation. It was mostly marketing hype. They apparently haven't done any lab testing to certify the filter in any way. So, I went to Renovo Trio's website to see if they had anything and they had overwhelming amounts of data. I found full testing documentation and some helpful information about the activated carbon filter. According to Renovo (who has done testing), the activated carbon filter is good for 1,000 liters OR 1 year out of its packaging (the Renovo is hermetically sealed). So, if this filter sat in some warehouse for 8 months or so before I received it, then I've got 3-4 months to use it before the activated carbon filter is useless. Don't get me wrong, as a two stage filter, this is pretty good but I paid for a three stage filter and that is what I was expecting.  Second, a week or so after ordering this, I get some telemarketer calling from Survivor Filter trying to get my email and other details so I can end up on some marketing list. I have NEVER had this happen on Amazon and I hope it doesn't become the norm.  So, if you are looking for something that will make you feel like you're prepared (when you really aren't) and you don't care to investigate the validity of a manufacturers claims, buy this! If you would prefer to buy from a company that tests their own products and stands behind their product without selling your name and contact details to a marketing company, then look elsewhere (Sawyer, Renovo, Berkey even Lifestraw).

I have had turtle beach headsets in the past and generally liked them, which is why I was a returning customer. They weren't the best, but for the price I was always happy.<br /><br />Well, something has changed because this set is unbelievably bad...<br /><br />It was less than a week before one of the speakers stopped working and the only way to get it to work was to bang on it multiple times.<br /><br />I could only keep them on for just over an hour because it would make my ears very sore, something I have never really had to deal with before.<br /><br />I would rate the sound as average, but definitely not better than any other set I have used before.

The Wire is one of my favorite shows of all time. I wasn't aware of it when it was still airing on HBO, but after hearing rave reviews I decided to purchase the box set and go from there. As my opening sentence asserts, that was a great decision.<br /><br />Except for the quality of the actual discs. Like others on here have mentioned, this box set is just not up to par. Four of my discs had disc read issues, and one of them managed to completely stop working mid-season. I've since had the entire set replaced, and although the new one works much better, from time to time it still skips or pauses randomly. To be honest, I'm not quite sure what happened during the production run of these as writing DVDs is usually a rather simple process, but something was definitely up.<br /><br />I wouldn't normally recommend this as I'm a firm believer that piracy is wrong, but my suggestion would be to buy the set so the cast and crew get their royalties and also downloading a digital copy for pain-free viewing. It's not illegal if you own the product, and honestly it'll save you quite a few headaches. I'm not going to provide you with a link, but let's just say it's not too hard to find if you're so inclined.<br /><br />I don't want to write a mini review on the series as there's many others out there, but I will say that the extra features in this set are fantastic and absolutely worth the price. They really let you delve into the world of Baltimore and see why it's such a terrible self reinforcing cycle. David Simon, despite being a bit of an a**hole, is nothing short of a genius.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review!

So you'll want something well over 50 gigs to download & install this. Quite a chunk of this "cleans up" after install but it comes in like the space hog it is. IMPORTANT do NOT run any files after download, get patch 1.05 and apply it before attempting to run anything. I had no problems with the Amazon side of things, and apart from some space issues the install went fine... registering the software was a bit more... problematic as the game gets tagged in Origins, EA, and Bioware social but in my case trying to launch from local shortcuts made me enter e-mail/pw for my online account then the reg code then telling me congrads w/big green play button which goes to we're sorry can't connect and that's it. For a week. Nothing. Yelled help and gave it a little time. Nada. So, after a week with no love from ea I tried something else and in literally 15min I was FINALLY able to boot the bloody thing... which I currently hold such a bad taste in my mouth over I'm gonna set her aside for now and give it a spin when I'm not so strungout over the effort to run the thing than all anticipation has turned to meh... will update when I can more fairly access gameplay.<br /><br />...<br /><br />So I start as a fantasy race female character who quickly ends up in a prima nocta situation from the human nobles, captured via cut scene, and fighting her way out of the dungeons with her cousin. This was immensely satisfying as the humans actions in slaughtering helpless companions left zero moral question to the violence and your party's toons are quickly splattered in the gore of your fallen human foes... HECK YEAH! They got their hook in me... and promptly forgot to set it as the immediate next "interaction" has the authorities come to arrest you and your cousin and the HUMAN there to recruit you into the Grey Wardens turns your cousin over taking only you with a stupid argument that your cousin will be safe locked up yet you'd surly be executed if you stay and anyway YOU stepped forward and told the truth (I guess the blood that covered the characters was likely to go unnoticed if I'd just kept quiet) that left me hating the main NPC. There's nothing to express contempt however, you just "choose" to cooperate which then results in your going to some town to meet a bunch of HUMANS shortly to be saddled with some silly task to become a Warden that you have to complete with a party of 3 other HUMANS... who you can't kill and who won't leave even when I killed some wounded guy pleading for help in cold blood right in front of them... half the time you have no option in interactions with them but polite ones which prove very frustrating for a character with every reason to hate all humans unconditionally and never, ever work with one. Oops, you can't be that character actually, forgive and forget, it's no big deal, do as your told... it's a story.<br />I don't like that story so I'm putting it down. It's too frustrating. I suppose I'll try a human noble character one day... Maybe the Grey Wardens will start looking like good guys from that perspective as whatever "story" is ruining the illusion of freewill that makes play interesting seems more suited to that protag type and the choices that character might make. They miss the range badly for this type with me at least.<br /><br />As far as play mechanics go it's Baldurs Gate spacebar=pause in 3d. it's a pretty thing but it has awkward moments, particularly around pinch-points like doorways, the very points most tactically useful on the maps, really amplifying the fiddly camera. This is easily overlooked in battles your interested in and not easy to overlook in mundane, filler battles where there always seems to be something more to click before the thing will move on.<br /><br />Also, by running a game accelerator that shuts down lots of background processes and setting the exe to compatability for xp sp3, as admin, disable themes, desktop, dpi I get a boot in and exit out that just crashes explorer not winblows altogether

After weeks of browsing and going back and forth between other products, deciding which infrared space heater to get in this style, I ordered this one and finally received it yesterday. I liked the fact that it has the air purifier AND humidifier built in, I was excited to use it to help lower my gas heating bill. It seemed to have pretty good reviews and I hoped it would work the same for me. But it did not.<br />It did not appear to be defective, it turned on and after a &#34;heat-up&#34; period it started blowing at &#34;full power&#34;. I placed it in a 12x14 room (8 foot ceiling) where my main furnace thermostat is located. The temperature on the furnace thermostat was set at 64 degrees. I wanted to see how much the room temp could be raised with this new heater so the furnace would not kick on. I left the heater running for FIVE HOURS non-stop. The room temperature would not rise over the 64 degrees and the furnace still kicked on even with the heater running. Maybe this one is just a dud, who knows. I have an old small Lasko ceramic heater that outputs more heat than this thing...<br />I have asked for a refund but because I bought from a third party seller (something I usually NEVER do) it will probably be a big hassle if they even agree to a refund and will probably end up costing me more to ship back than the item is worth :(

It definitely fits in with the mumblecore movement, even though the posters want you to think it's a real light-hearted comedy affair. So if you're looking for a cool, fun comedy about drinking buddies, that's not quite this.<br /><br />That said, I knew what I was getting into when I watched it, and I still just wasn't that into it.  But again, I think that's because I'm not a big lover of the low-fi mumblecore thing in general.  A lot of meandering scenes, derived from improv.  A lot of really nebulous character moves without much resolution.  It felt like watching people workshop a play, sort of...and you could imagine the play being really good if they thought it out harder, but then they didn't.

I got this mattress as a replacement to the old one hoping it would work well and be comfortable without spending a fortune. That being said, I just couldn't sleep on this thing.

I tried everything I could to make it work, but I just couldn't do it. I wasn't happy with it and I couldn't take it anymore.<br /><br />After doing some research I went with a different mattress here on Amazon and I'm so happy I did. My only complaint is that I should have purchased it in the first place and saved myself time and discomfort.

It works till the next rain, or the sprinklers go on or at most about two weeks. I have found the cleanest way to dissolve it is to put some carefully in an empty 2 liters soft drink bottle, add water, and then shake it about. Then let it sit overnight and shake it some more. The problems is that unless you are willing to filter it, it can clog up the little holes in the sprayer nozzle. So using it continuously can be quite frustrating and time consuming. After 2 years, I still have most of my plantskydd remaining. The deer always win!

Maybe it's my fault for jumping on this, and not reading the reviews carefully but not buying myself a toy for years (just my wife and daughter) I figured I would treat myself. Wrong treatment. Ok this thing is cool, I'll give it that, but for the love of all that is Holy, the thing just took off on me and crashed in the woods nearby, and when I mean crash, I mean crashed into a few pieces. I was going to buy the Parrot, but heard its limited as far as the Bluetooth will go? And that they have a tendency to do take off only never to return.<br /><br />Thankfully mine was located for a swift back in the box and refund (thank you Prime). Ive seen some really cool videos taken with thing and a lot of people say its great. I think its just a hit or miss, and I missed. Could it have been my fault? Maybe, but I don't remember, plus I thought it had some safety mechanism to prevent this. This impact was so rough I had no access to the crash or I would post it.<br /><br />Great concept, just not there, it's kinda like the ‘flying car'.

I can't imagine anyone wearing these leggings anywhere else but to a strip club. they are incredibly reveling, and unless you have the body of Jennifer Lawrence, I would not advice it at all. I am in my late 30s and decided to wear it at my house and let me tell you that my children thought I was being slutty. I am not wearing these stripper clothes anywhere.<br /><br />From the front they are not so bad, but from the back it's like almost transparent. Otherwise they are kinda nice.

We bought this TV for our den where our kids usually hang out and relax after school. I'd say the TV is on about 2-3 hours per day. The TV worked well for about 2 years, then after the warranty mark (after Samsung wont fix it for free) the TV started to have white dots. These dots increased in number every week, until the screen itself was covered in a tapestry as dense as the night's sky. I sincerely believe this is done on purpose, to force us to buy new TVs.

It says black. It's not black. All of the negative reviews say it. I'm so frustrated that I didn't read them and take that advice. That's really the biggest thing. I can't even use it if it isn't the right color. Amazon should do something to check this so we aren't stuck with touch-up paint we can't even use at the end of the day. Worst part? I can't even return it because there isn't a "legitimate” reason and I should have known what I was buying. Ugh!

I purchased this TV last month as a living room TV. I saw the great price and decent reviews online and decided to take a risk and purchase a TV that had mixed reviews... Boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for only $80 more. Trust me, $80 extra is worth the better quality TV and not having to deal with a bad quality TV and returning that bad TV.<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 40 inch TV, check this one out -----&#62; http://amzn.to/SCb3Qp it is here on Amazon. I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!

The game represents a tremendous amount of effort and investment and, for those impressed by such things, Resident Evil 6 may delight. But all the effort in the world won't make up for a lack of vision. This game is blind to imagination and focus. Capcom's uncertainty about the series' identity post-Mikami (and post-Uncharted) is hardcoded into its structure: four campaigns offering different, flawed expressions of that potential. And the inevitable price for this wavering is a lack of coherence. Resident Evil 6 is an unwieldy tribute to the series' past, an uneven expression of its present and an unwelcome indication of its future.

This book is a pleasure on the mind. A good old fashioned sword-wielding adventure in which Casca and his band of new mercenaries, made up from different tribes, must rescue the princess from a foreign land.<br /><br />With a daring trip along the river by boat, the band must save the crew and a rather dodgy captain from the attack of the tribesman, who have a vendetta against Mattias. As the tale unravels, one of the group is killed and Casca begins to investigate, who was it? As the clues drop he begins to suspect that all is not as it seems.<br /><br />Not everyone is who they claim they are, and it was a fascinating and brutal end to the story. Saddler would have been chuffed if he could have written this, I don't mean to over do it, but without offending anyone, I think mr Roberts is becoming just as big a talent as Saddler ever was.. There isn't much between the stories mr Roberts is producing now and the best from Saddler.<br /><br />Just like to point out that Mattias is such a great character, the best in any of the Roberts era, bar casca himself obviously.<br /><br />I vaguely remember someone saying in an earlier review that mr Roberts tried to make casca seem like a '1970s touchy feely guy'.. I think this book is more than enough to dismiss that claim as pure ignorance and retardedness.<br /><br />Excellent work mr Roberts, keep it up!!

I received these screen protectors today, and could not be more pleased! I dropped my phone recently and cracked the screen. Although it did not affect the functionality of the device, I had been keeping Saran Wrap over the screen to keep glass particles out of my fingers. This was less than satisfactory, due to the wrinkles. The protectors are smooth and glossy, just as the original screen was (before cracks). So far, not a single fingerprint or smudge has appeared, like were on the screen before. I highly recommend this item! This will buy me some time for use, while I try to decide on repair versus total replacement (all of which are expensive options). No matter which option I choose, I will continue to use these protectors.

Pros:<br />I love Razer packaging. I believe it is the start of the experience and design that shows they pay attention to detail.<br />This product is very easy to instal and setup. The wide variety of settings and possible programing make it ideal through several types of games and uses.<br /><br />Con:<br />While it is wireless, the wireless requires the included base. This is fine for desktop uses, but for a laptop it would have been nice to see Bluetooth like the Razer Orochi.<br /><br />Overall I love the Razer family of mice so far, and will be looking into their keyboards next.

I was glad the day i came across this selfie stick on amazon and i received it as a gift from this amazing seller. I really cant wait to get my hands on it after it was shipped from the seller, my selfie experience is now an awesome one, i give this selfie stick an A***  because its really awesome. I now flood my social media page with my selfie, i took it along with me to any place i go, as it makes it easier for me to take a breath taking selfie. I look beautiful in them and it makes me love it the most, the setting up of the selfie stick was pretty easy for me.<br />This is a highly recommended product for selfie lovers.

I think the reason supplements get such widely mixed reviews is that everyone is looking for a magic pill. They want to make no other changes, take a pill and want the fat to melt away. I have never heard of anything that's ever happened like this.<br /><br />Personally I was in what is considered the 'overweight' range for my height and build. Everyone said I looked great and scoffed at the idea of being 'overweight', but I kind of felt it. Clothes were getting snug and I wasn't comfortable with my own appearance. So I set out to get into the 'healthy' weight range by dropping 20 lbs. or so. I started a regular regimen of exercise and began to watch my caloric intake. After about 8 or 9 weeks I had plateaued after losing about 12-13 lbs. It was frustrating - my weight even slipped up a bit even though I continued my diet and exercise program.<br /><br />I did the research on coffee bean extract. Naturally the reviews are all over the place. I figured I didn't have a lot to lose by trying it out, so I got a bottle of this stuff. I'm through the first bottle now and the weight loss is staggering. I immediately blew through the plateau and I've dropped another 10 lbs. in 4 weeks. I've reached my goal but now I'm getting greedy. I'm wondering whether I continue losing to get to the mid-point of the 'healthy' range. I'm very close and there's still a bit of flab here and there that I'd like to see go away. I did still continue with my exercise program at the same time.<br /><br />Again, if you're looking for a magic pill move on. In my opinion, and I'm certainly no expert, these supplements only work in combination with changing the behaviors that got you overweight in the first place. This one seems to work extremely well when applied in that fashion.

I bought these as birthday gift for my girlfriend after another pair she had would not stay up any more time. I have to say, they are really attractive and fit very well. Even after some vigorous.....exercising, they did not move an inch and stayed up beautifully. These are very sleek and sexy. She used these to put on in her webcam show, where she does some very active dancing. These stockings not only looked amazing, but they did not move the entire time she was gyrating all over the place lol. These are really the bomb on my wife, she has great looking legs and these really set them off, best advantage is they keep up.

I would like to share how effective Forskolin Extract with Garcinia Cambogia is for me. These are the effects on me after a month:<br /><br />1. It made me lose 25 pounds in one month. It made my belly slimmer which I believe has the most stubborn fats on my whole body.<br /><br />2. It suppressed my appetite so much. I usually eat 3 heavy meals a day and 3 more snack time every time I feel the urge to eat. But after a week of taking it, I already felt full after a heavy meal in the morning, and would just east light meal in the afternoon with no snack time in between because I still feel full.<br /><br />3. I have experienced no unwanted side effects like dizziness, headache or anything unfamiliar.<br /><br />This really made my life better and I am so thankful that I have found this Extract by Bio Green. I recommend it to everyone who wants to lose weight.<br /><br />- Ana Thorpe, Helen Thorpe's Sister

Used to be when I'd travel by plane, I'd bring a book, a stack of magazines, a large bottle of water and of course, I able to wear shoes with laces. Obviously, there's a new world order and traveling means I have to stay in touch with everyone at all times! Besides hauling my Mac Book, I now bring my iPhone, iPad, slide on shoes and because of TSA restrictions, no water bottle.<br /><br />I'm not phased by dehydration. Like most travelers, my fear of all fears, is that my electronics will lose their power, while in midair! I get the shakes at being left with no phone to tell my family, friends and colleagues that I'm waiting on a line or bored. I also shudder at having no books, magazines or emails from work to read. After all, without any power, I am a broken man - dehydrated, staring at my slip ons.<br /><br />I'd heard that external batteries were an option but thought they were expensive, bulky and not dependable. After hearing my son Alex rave about his battery pack, I decided to read some independent reviews and take a cyber stroll to Amazon. Review after review highlighted PBS's superb quality, reliability and features. However, my foremost reason for going with PBS was their excellent customer service. I noticed that if in fact there was a negative review, Anker remedied each and every malady. As a result of my research, I decided to order the PBS, PBS Smart 7000mAh External Battery Pack  for $35.99, at Amazon.

What a fantastic deal! I got a huge box of these for a great price. I love carrying these in my purse and in my backpack. I take them all over with me. I like these better than the little bottles of hand sanitizer because they do not squish out. I have had more purses and bags ruined or drenched in sanitizer because of the little bottles. These wrapped wipes are perfect for me no leaking, no squishing, just perfect! I love them and love them scent! They are perfect for what I need!! You can also drop these in the kids backpacks for easy access too!! Don't forget camping season is coming up we are planning on taking these with us.

Snug fit and it has a lip above the screen. Didn't interfere with my screen protector, which is rare to find for S5. The cutouts are nice size and has no issues. Slightly raised above the camera on the back as well (although it's hard to realize. I put a book on the back to cover the lens half way and was able to slide a paper between the two, so it means there is some space between the camera and the desk if you lay down the case). Overall it's a great case and the price is right.

It has been a challenge to find the perfect case for the iPhone 6 Plus. I am sure I am not the only one who has this problem. The phone itself is really big and wide that it can not fit into my pockets without sticking out halfway. I can't risk putting it in my bag because it has many objects that can scratch or scrape the phone like keys, paper clips, and coins. That's why I decided to purchase this clear case to preserve my phone's original appearance. t does a great job in sealing up every corner and edge of the phone to prevent any dust from getting trapped inside. Such an amazing case to purchase at this affordable price with excellent quality.

I started exercising and losing weight and getting into shape about a year ago and let me just tell you it has been the most rewarding journey for me, I look great and I feel better than I ever have in my life. I owe part of it to these pills. These raspberry ketones are all natural and all pure, so basically 100% pure raspberry ketones, with nothing else added to it, they also supply 500mg of raspberry ketone which is a high dosage and will surely help. I started taking them late last year and they have put me on the right track.<br />I have managed to lose about 35 pounds during the whole journey and I couldn't be more proud. This wasn't all accomplished through the pill, I wish it was that easy but the fact is I had to work and I had to work hard! This pill combined with proper diet and exercise can help you reach your weight loss goals. If you're already on a diet and exercise scheme and needing a little help, try these pills.

I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I love it. Taste wise, its not the best but the pill is easy to swallow.  It is not a magic pill so you need to do some exercise.  Just try cutting back on how much you eat. Add a banana for a snack , or serve yourself the regular amount that you usually would and then cut it down the middle and only eat half.  Remember to drink a lot of water during the day. And lastly eat a great breakfast!  Cut out the pop!  If you try eating small snacks during the day to keep your metabolism constantly working fast... You will shed the pounds ;) Hope this helped-

I'm a long-distance runner. I keep in shape by doing at least 5-6 miles a day, I run marathons and 10ks whenever I have the chance. Running is almost a form of meditation for me. But as I've gotten older it's been harder and harder to cover the same distances, even at slower paces. Worse still, I had started feeling completely wiped out for two or three days after a big race. I thought I might have to give up my running, or at least cut way back. I was just tired of being tired all the time.<br />Estrovoid totally turned things around for me. It hasn't made me faster or improved my stamina, really, but since I've been taking it my recovery times have gone way down. Soreness and aches and pains are all much less now than they were before I started taking this stuff. I don't know if it would work as well for everybody, but I think it's at least worth trying.

One often does not know the quality of a product from just looking at a picture online.  I needed a new grater and liked the looks of this one.

In 2011, the journal of gastroenterology found that green coffee bean increased average weight loss by 5.5 pounds in THREE different studies. This was on an extremely low dose of only 200MG a day. If it wasn't for this, I probably wouldn't have bought a supplement like this, but the evidence is hard to ignore.<br /><br />Naturabest's bottle recommends a dose of 800mg, which is considered the appropriate amount for this supplement.<br /><br />I personally started taking this supplement 3 weeks ago, taking ONE dose per day, on my way home from work, before dinner. I really started noticing a reduction in appetite after about one week taking the supplement religiously, so it may take that much time or longer for you. Since I started taking green coffee bean extract, I have lost 6.5Lbs total.<br /><br />I have toyed with the idea of taking two doses per day, but I'm in no huge rush to lose weight (I have been overweight my entire life), and don't want to overdo it. I AM losing weight, and I WILL keep it off, and this supplement is helping me accomplish that in an easier way than I would have ever thought possible before. This brand seems on par in price with other brands, I picked this one because it was the first one that showed up when I searched on amazon and it wasn't dishonestly priced (sometimes I worry about products that seem a little too cheap).<br /><br />I will continue buying this product until I have reached my goal weight (22.5 more pounds to go), and then I will take this as-needed once I am there.

I also like the 60 day money back guarantee that is available. Im just trying to loose a few pounds so I can afford to put on a few for the holidays or at least maintain  my weight. So far ten days into and I have lost 3 lbs and i feel great. Im staring off slow only taking it 2 times a day now just so i can be sure i have no side affects or like allergies to it.I got to say its working just like they said it would and no side affects to report. i feel like my body is adjusting and im getting the energy i need with out having to drink a ton of coffee like i normally do.

Like millions of people I have tried losing weight a ton of times. I tried just exercising, but I only lost about five months after two months. So, I tried exercising and eating healthy, but I only lost about five more months after about a month. So, my mom told me about this product that she found online, Raspberry Ketone Liquid drops, and I ordered it. After using this product, plus exercising and eating healthy for about three weeks I lost ten pounds. So, I say, if I person wants to lose weight they should eat healthy, exercise regularly and take this product. This weight loss regimen is working for me so what do you have to lose, give it a try. I don't usually recommend products or do reviews, but I wanted everyone to know how I have been able to lose weight and feel better.

From my teen years to my adulthood I have suffered from wrinkles on my face. I didn't know the reason of it but it really disgusted me when I looked in the mirror. I'm in my early 30's and my face looked more like of a 55 year old. I needed immediate assistance and luckily I stumbled across this Botox alternative acid and to be honest, I've never felt more confident in myself. My deep wrinkles are barely noticeable and I've only been using this for a short time. Can't wait some more time to pass and I'll finally look how I wanted to.

I may be picky on product in many terms, but everyone should care about what they are eating if you are taking it for a long time. I have searched on many other similar turmeric products, and this product is one of them that satisfies its values. Do your own research and know it.<br />I have been using Tumeric Curcumin for the past three months and I have found that it has done wonders in relieving some of my health conditions. It's an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and it has been known to help those with Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, allergies, diabetes, and other chronic ailments. I deal with a lot of chronic pain, allergies, and other chronic conditions. I like that at times it eases a bit of my pain too. Great product highly recommend it!

Great entry level R/C boat with awesome features. The low battery alarm removes any concerns about getting the boat stranded I the middle of the lake. The self-righting feature works well (from what I can tell, it works by using the torque of the motor when you alternate from reverse to forward quickly). The boat is hard to capsize on smooth, calm water; however, it flips over easily in rough water. The hull seems very durable. The digital transmitter has great range and uses the same frequency spectrum as cordless telephones (much better than the older transmitters that use the standard telescoping metal antenna). Great boat for the price.

As a practicing OB/GYN, I often felt limited in my ability to counsel patients regarding nutritional health.  After reading Nutritional Harmony I routinely reference the book in my daily practice. I can now better educate my patients on the importance of whole foods, dietary supplements and a healthy gut. I frequently make reference to the "magic trio,” and my patients have been very receptive to Dr. Fall's holistic approach.  Nutritional Harmony provides a clear and concise guide to disease prevention.  It is a long- awaited nutritional guide that is an invaluable tool for both physicians and patients.

OK, I have never tried a product like this but I will never hesitate again to try one. I have only used this a couple times and my skin feels softer and more smooth than it has in a while. Ive even noticed a small decrease in redness in my cheeks and chin. The smell is a little bad but it goes away as it soaks into the skin. I also used this prior to putting on make up and it worked almost like a primer. Just remember to let it dry first. I will for sure be purchasing some more once I run out. I love this serum.

I have been looking for something to replace having to use so many pads while I am on my menstrual cycle. I got these and they are great! The first thing that I noticed was that they are very convenient to carry around due to the way they fold up. They fit easily into my purse for when I am on the go. It has a really soft feel to it! A problem I have with pads is that I have allergic reactions down there so I have to be very careful. These did not break me out and are so easy to use. I clip it on and it stays in place. When I am done I fold it up and then throw it in the wash when I am home. The reusable pads do not let it leak and come in handy. I was offered this as a promotion for my honest opinion.

This 5 hour energy drink is something special. It really works for me and is a much better alternative to coffee, which I will not drink (saw my dad actually become addicted to coffee and then every time he would try to stop got incredibly awful withdrawal headaches). Personally, just taking a few sips of this thing can keep me going for a couple of hours straight, which means that the product lasts a long time.<br /><br />For those who would prefer a tea type of drink that gives a lot of energy, I have also recently tried this one (works great for me): [[ASIN:B00IDXDQ9I All Natural Organic - High Energy Caffeine Instant Black Tea Powder (Over 100 Servings Per Package) - Buy One Get One Free!]]. I like this because the energy kick that it provides is very smooth. It is strong, to be sure, and you will feel it almost right away, but it also tastes really good (which is a big advantage for all you 5-hr energy drinkers). The added caffeine is what makes this effective, so it might not be something you want to use every day, but for when a nice burst of continuous energy is needed, this comes in quite handy.

I bought this product a month ago but was only able to start on it a week ago because I wanted to see for myself first if it works. It is the first dietary supplement I'm taking and I was a bit wary. My friend got one, too, and she agreed to be my "test subject". After two weeks of intake, there's a visible lessening to her  waistline. When we eat, she gets full so easily that she actually complains about it when she really likes what she's eating! After three weeks, she'd lost about 7 pounds. The best part is there are no side effects that I know of and she seems to feel great all the time. It's a week now, and I have gone through what she's going through, and have also already lost 3 pounds to my weight. I think it's really working like a charm. My sister has now ordered her bottle, too, and is on her first day.

We all have been there. Our baby pets suddenly start being a little more loud than we like. I live in an apartment complex and having a pet means constantly keeping my Scottie under leash and keep him as quiet as possible. All was going well until a few months back when he started this weird fantasy of barking at any and everything that moves. And that means a constant source of noise the ENTIRE day! At first I thought it was a phase and would soon go away, but even after a few weeks, it kept going on. One of my neighbors in the complex suggested me this collar after having successfully used it on her dog. I waited a few more days but when it got unbearable, I had to order it.<br />It's been 2 weeks now since I have been using this on Scottie. And believe me when I say this, my home is much more peaceful now! Even without the collar, he doesn't bark as much. I think he is trained now! I am gradually going to stop using the collar if he keeps up with this!

My friend and I have been using raspberry ketones for about 30 days each and we've both lost almost 10 pounds. I used to use another brand of ketones but it wasn't working as well for me. When I noticed that this one had great reviews I decided to give it one last shot before giving up. I'm really glad I did because this is much better than the other brand I was using. My appetite is very much in control now and my friend says she can barely eat. We're still not sure if that's a good or a bad thing, but hey, it's helping with the weight loss for now, why not?

This product has done a superb job of really lowering my blood pressure. As a side note, I started taking this for blood pressure, but noticed a slight... "viagra" effect, each time I take the recommended dosage on an empty stomach. I also started taking tribulus, [[ASIN:B006QRHMWU 25 Grams (0.88 Oz) Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder (Strongest Tribulus on the market)]] which enhanced these effects ten-fold. Not the reason I initially sought out this supplement, but you won't hear me complaining. The powder form of L-Arginine (and anything for that matter) is something I prefer over pills since the cost gets cut in half, literally and I notice taking the powder has a more immediate effect rather than waiting for the capsules to disintegrate. Either way, L-Arginine is a terrific solution for lowering the blood pressure and upping performance in the bedroom, and a little bit of tribulus doesn't hurt either ; )

Poison Study is a great beginning to the Study series. The book is about a girl named Yelena who is next in line to be executed for murder. But she is given a choice by the chief of security. That choice is to either become the food taster for the Commander of Ixia or to die for her crime of murder. She chooses to become the food taster. Follow Yelena as she discovers secrets about her past that even she never knew about herself.<br />  The greatest strength for this book is the appealing storyline in which everything is in perfect order and nothing is either spread thin or too concentrated.<br />  Although the storyline is strong, however, the plot has a few holes in it. For example, the author would introduce a character but you would never see that character mentioned in the rest of the book. Other than that, this book was an awesome read which I wouldn't mind reading again.

Icy Cool Roller works well on my legs and back.  For years, I occasionally get shooting pain in my back and shoulders from work.  Until now, I could never find an affordable useful product that helps heal these issues.  In fact, I was skeptical at first because I never heard of such a product until I spoke to my chiropractor.  She uses it in her office for her clients and uses it at home as well.  She said it was new and provides consistent deep tissue stimulation to muscles and skin...she was right.  This is one of the few products that is not only affordable to buy as a patient, it actually works without any difficult technology or energy use.  If you are looking to rub out sore muscles, this is a must have product.  I use it at home watching television.

The story had twists and turns that I didn't expect in a vampire story, a genre I don't usually read, but it held my attention to the end. As soon as I reached the middle of the book, I literally couldn't put it down until I reached the last page.

I found this new kitchen gadget recently. It is an aluminum lemon squeezer with a long handle from RiseKitch. This is my new favorite thing! I love how it is so powerful and gets every drop of juice from the lemon or lime out. I also like that the juice does not squirt all over. In the past on my previous juicer I have had juice squirt in my eyes all over the counter and not go where I wanted to go. Now the juice falls straight down to the glass. No seeds and no pith, that is trapped in the bowl. I have been looking for recipes now that use citrus juice since this is so easy to use for me. Fresh lemonade or lemon bars very easy to make now.<br /><br />The press is made of food-safe aluminum material with a beautiful coating. It won't rust, scratch, pit or crack. Plus, it's has the strength to give you many years of reliable use.

This RTGS 30 Micro LED Super Bright string lights with green wire are amazing. It can fit for your purpose either for indoor or outdoor use due to the waterproof design.  There are several settings which are much more sophisticated than those you get on Xmas tree lights, house plant, or other decorative projects. The wire is nice and malleable so it's very easy to bend and manipulate round your wall or object.    I used them mainly to decorate my house plant and the upcoming Christmas tree and the result is amazing.  The LED lights are bright, fresh, clean and crisp.  The light includes 30 LED lights with 10' in length green flexible wire.  The lights are water proof and it requires 6 of AA batteries to operate.  The battery could last up to 14 days and the on/off timer setting is great.    I like the fact this LED light features 8 operating functions that can be activated by pressing button consecutively with simple and easy set up.  1. Combination  2. In Wave  3. Sequential  4. Slow Fade / Every Other Light  5. Chasing / Flash  6. Slow Fade / All Lights  7. Twinkle / Flash  8.

After using this product for about 2 months I've seen results, i've definitely lost at least an inch off my waist. Drink a lot of water and try maybe 30 minutes before instead of the recommended 2 hours. Because cmon it's kinda hard to predict when you'll have a chance to eat especially if you have a busy day. What I do is whenever im feelin a little hungry I just go ahead and take the pill and then I distract myself for about half an hour and then boom chow down. Using this got me a motivated to go to the gym too just to try and further receive some results, but trust me im not doing anything too exhausting there. So for me personally, dropping soda and drinking water, Im working towards my goal. Hopefully this helps.

This truly is a beautiful set that is sure to complete any outfit and get you many compliments. The bracelet does seem to run small but I have smaller wrists so that is something to keep in mind when purchasing. The earrings shimmer very nicely and have metal backs. I have sensitive ears and worried about having silver backs, but my ears were fine and didn't seem to get irritated from them. The cell phone bling is perfect and adds so much style to my phone. It also protects the headphone jack from getting anything in it. The bracelet is gorgeous. It shuts very easily and there is no worry about a clasp with this item. It stays on securely. The necklace chain seems to be just the right amount of length. Clasp on the necklace is easy to open and closes nicely. It seems durable as it hasn't broke yet and I have worn this for over a week daily to check. I have also messed with it as well. The chain is really dainty but hasn't ripped and I am pretty notorious with doing that. The charm is brilliant. It shimmers and shines and the gem seems to catch the light at all the right angles. This is a cute set.

My honest opinion is that it is great. First off it is a huge container of powder. I started adding it to my chocolate milk. I throw it in my shaker bottle so that I make sure that it dissolves fully. When adding it with milk I can't really taste the citrus flavor. After just a few days My nails are slightly stronger. I also have joint pains and it has helped those go away some.

I was looking for a portable speaker and decided to try this Free Spirit 12 by SoundPal.<br />I was surprised at the size of this speaker and has a huge difference in sound quality from my other portable speakers. I could definitely hear the lows and the highs and more importantly the bass. I selected this model in color black with the red dots.<br />The speaker did not take long to charge on the initial charge. I paired my iPhone with my new speaker and played a few songs from my device. I then listened to some music from Sirius and Pandora. I was definitely hearing vibrant and lifelike music.<br />I initially liked the &#34;voice&#34; that helps with the pairing of the devices. I can see how it might get annoying after awhile, but I didn't find how to turn it off anywhere in the user manual.<br />While connected to my iPhone, I can adjust the volume from my device or from the speaker.<br />I'm very happy with my purchase. Money well spent. I do highly recommend this speaker.

I got this , and I'm so impressed with it! It is  screen protector, almost like a very thin case. I was worred about using it, thinking that as thick as it is, there's no way it could be as responsive as the little flimsy cover that was on my phone... but it's just as responsive. And it does appear to be a lot more fingerprint-resistant than the one I was using.<br />I got a  screen protector  + with a wet cleaning wipe and a dry cleaning wipe and a dust-absorber.

Perfect to keep energy up when in front of the computer all day. I ordered it to replace an old box style Ott light purchased many years ago. Replacement bulbs for that are no longer available and it had lost its brightness. I used to leave it on all day long.

Pros:<br />It has Google Play Store to download apps you want<br />The box has three USB ports, which can connect different USB devices at same time (mouse/keyboard/hard drive/USB/Webcam)<br />Point remote control is good for playing games<br />Preload XBMC<br />HDMI cable included<br />Cons:<br />Remote control is a little sensitive, so need some time to get used to<br />Its better if can make interface simpler.<br />Overall, this box is still good, for me, android TV box is much better than streaming only player, because you can do much more things on your TV through this box.

I read this book 2 1/2 years ago, loved it then, still love it now!  I don't remember how much detail the author gave on nootropics but it was after reading this book I began my quest to sharpen my mind and improve my overall cognitive functioning.  This book is inspiring as it is factual, in my opinion.<br /><br />Besides following the exercises clearly outlined in this book, I also began researching and eventually taking a combination of nutritional supplements called nootropics (i.e. piractem, aniracetam, etc).  They were first discovered 30+ years ago and were used to treat serious medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.  Then after scientists began recommending them as cognitive enhancers to the public, they started to become a very popular brain supplement.<br /><br />They are a very intriguing family of supplements.  My suggestion to anyone looking to improve their brain function is to look into some type of natural brain supplement, everyone is different so do your own research like I did and decide for yourself if it's a good idea.  Besides experimenting with a few nootropics, I've been taking ginseng and ginko for years, [[ASIN:B009K30D28 Ginseng Complex Plus Royal Jelly (1000 Mg) + FREE Ginkgo Biloba Extract (30 Mg) 60 Tablets]].  They're inexpensive and effective, plain and simple.<br /><br />And of course if you haven't already, read this book which, for me, was my personal inspiration and the beginning of my journey to a better me; [[ASIN:1594480931 The Better Brain Book]].

I bought this case for my brother, as he's a massive music addict and a very active person. He's listening to music everywhere he goes, whether it's while going into the tub or actually climbing at a mountain, he doesn't care where or when, he needs his music. He already broke 2 phones that way, and with his rather new iPhone 5s I didn't want that to happen.  After dropping it on the floor, dipping it in water and mud and scratching it on rock, I must say this case is perfect for hardcore usage. Of course there's signs of usage all over the case, scratches and dents, but it never failed its purpose. My brother's phone is still alive, and the apparent solidity of this case will make sure that it will stay in this state.

Great price and a quality product for fine grinding. Silver color, looks much more expensive than the price tag. You won't be disappointed unless you have unrealistic expectations. This is a nice tool to have at a very good price. Con: No cleaning brush included as the photo shows. Mine came packaged in a thin plastic bag with no padding and no way to close the bag. But no damage in the box which did have additional cushioning inside. For the price, you can beat it man. In a hemp shop these things run for 4x the price. This things works great when grinding up your cough cough &#34;herbs and cooking garnishes&#34; :) For the price, you can beat it man. In a hemp shop these things run for 4x the price.

I love how easy it is to put the protection glass screen over my phone, it basically just slips onto the phone. I've already dropped my phone, and it hasn't shattered so I Would say the glass is exactly what it says, super impressed! It has lasted longer than any glass protection I have bought since along time, my phone reacts with my finger with the glass on which is a super plus, previous models didn't, I would have to take the glass screen off, and put it right back on. This one is the best protection in my opinion!

I tried this product with plenty of water and did not need to take it with meals.  I prefered to take it 2 hours after a meal.  It seems to have extended the time till I felt the need to eat again and did eliminate the snack craving in between.  I did not have any stomach problems or nausea. The product does not have a nasty aftertaste and can be swallowed fairly easy. I did not notice a huge weight loss, but I also do not stick to a regular diet and exercise and should I have done so I am sure it would have worked a lot better.

I had this tempered glass screen protector for about two months now and it works like a charm. For its price it is very cost efficient and easy to put on.

Therefore you can go wrong with this cost efficient tampered glass screen protector fits perfectly on the iPhone 6, no problems. it was really cheap, so I'm not complaining.

I'm thinking that I will review this along with the moringa capsules because I'm taking both right now. I got the moringa for migraines and garcinia for losing some weight this holiday, instead of the opposite tendency. Keep in mind it could be the combination that is helping but the migraines are far less frequent or severe. As for weight loss all I can say is that it is making a dent in my appetite, so that's nice and hopefully will get me through the holidays with a decrease in my weight. We will see and for now I feel satisfied eating less often so that earns five stars.

I use Alpha Lipoic Acid for a  Mitochondrial disease which it aids in the absorption of Coenzyme Q10 which I take (well I take Ubiquinol) to give me energy. It is used also for peripheral nerve degeneration and also helps control blood sugar levels - so if you are diabetic is will help lower blood sugar. Everyone is different on how much it lowers so be careful when you first start taking it so that you don't go too low on you. It also helps to detox the liver of metal pollutants, blocks cataract formation and reduce blood cholesterol levels. Everyone should be taking it.

I am so in love with this knife and peeler set. First of all, they look so stylish. I love the black vibe from it all. The blade cover for the knife is awesome so I can store it away in my drawer and not cut myself trying to get it. The are both lightweight and very easy to use. I find the grip comfortable on both handles. I love that I don't have to sharpen this knife as it keeps its razor sharp edge and will not wear out. I find this ceramic knife to be more sanitary than my others. All it needs is a quick rinse in between cutting different food items. I also know that this won't rust out. I love the price tag on this knife because they usually go for a lot more. I'm very happy with this knife and plan to expand my collection of ceramic knives for cooking.

There are so many companies making tempered glass. How do you choose? In doing my research I have discovered that one of the best choices is Besgoods. Their tempered glass is on the thinner size and while you may think that is not a good thing it actually is. It provides for a better fit in your iPhone 6 case, especially the cases with the built in battery packs.<br />You will get a HD ( high definition ) picture like none you have ever seen. The glass is rated 9H which is a very high rating for being scratch resistant. You will also see a big change since fingerprints and the oils they leave behind are a thing of the past.<br />The installation process is actually very easy but you must read the directions. You will find everything you need in the package. You start by cleaning off your phones screen with the wipe they enclosed, and then dry it. Then you line up the openings, and lay it down on the screen. You get no bubbles at all. If you need to move it you just carefully lift it off and do it again. There is no residue left behind. They did a great job with all the cutouts for the camera and everything else that made it easy to make everything line up.<br />You have to be crazy to use the old fashioned plastic sheets to protect your screen. They leave bubbles and don't protect your screen at all. Once you try Besgoods Tempered Glass you will use nothing else ever again.

Without the extras, it could easily serve as sort of a a daily carry heavy duty college book backpack. I'm 5'8&#34; & 160 lbs. & when I wear it it doesn't look over-sized or burdensome on my back. Fully packed, it's not going to stick out above my head or stick out from my body 3'on the back. Yet, it'll hold a folded riding crop with no problem. The small removable deployment pack on the lower back isn't so low that it bounces off my butt. The slightly ribbed and padded back plate is not made of rubber or silicon as it looked in some of the photo's. It's a padded vented canvas material that has been molded or formed into a ribbed 1/2 chevron design that rests against your back. The straps are relatively wide, but not as thickly padded as I had hoped. I'll update this review after a few months of use & let everyone know if the straps dig in too much. The molle strips on the top and middle of the back are a relatively short at 6&#34; long. I'm accustomed to 8 1/2.&#34; Six inches is probably OK for the average guy with an average backpack but it's almost too short for many of us. The molle strips on the side are only 3 1/2&#34; long.

There seems to be no shortage of cable standards on the market today, and there is no sign that these trends will tapper off any time soon.

But I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that my latest HDTV did not support component audio and I had to purchase a separate optical cable.<br /><br />Fortunately, Amazon offers a very competitively priced good quality optical cable. As I already mentioned, I haven't had much of an experience with these cables, but AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable seems to be as good as you could possibly hope for. It is durable, flexible, and long enough to connect any two devices. The sound quality is exceptionally good and only limited by the audio system that you are using. There is absolutely no reason to buy a more expensive cable from a different brand. I highly recommend it.

Overall, it's a superb drawing by the author that helped me dive into the thrilling murder mystery so easily.

The proof of how effective these things is in what the scales tell me. It tastes fine, it isn't a punishment to drink, and it doesn't interfere with any other part of my life, like some other diets I've tried. The knock on effect is that I don't feel hungry all the time, and therefore don't eat. Simple, really. I'm no fan of fads, as they generally come and go, but this stuff seems to be a good catalyst for my making real change in my weight. So, five stars from me.

These are great headphones especially for music lover mind.  Its HIFI strong low bass speaker included. Only when I went up to higher than normal listening levels did the midst really sound kind of &#34;muddy&#34;. But music lover and most people wouldn't listen to audio at these levels, so I find that perfectly fine. Even at louder than ideal listening levels I didn't have ear pain with these, so I do think they'd be great for music lover.

This is a great case for my new phone. I'm pretty easy on my phones and I purchased a ballistic cover for the front so this provides the added simple protection I needed in a case. I like that it is clear so I can still see the nice base color of my phone. This case gives the phone a little lift so when I place it face down the screen isn't directly on the surface. It also provides a nice hand feel when I'm holding the phone. It isn't bulky and I'm able to easily slide my phone in my back pocket.

First of all, I understand that not every product will work for every individual. But, this one is far exceeding my expectations. I did some research online before I bought this.I'm 35 and acne runs in my family. My mom still has it. I was starting to develop very deep, painful acne that would heal in one place and then show up in another place. Nothing I was doing was getting rid of it. I found this Product and I noticed some improvement the very next day. I'm a little over a week into it now and I can't believe the improvement! I'm going to recommend this product to anyone I know who battles with acne, like I did.

&#34;I decided to buy it knowing that Amazon has a great returns policy. I figured I would compare it to the other brand and return which ever one I did not like. Places like eBay and even other storefronts have a lot of issues when dealing with returns. I've pretty much just decided to avoid some of those other retailers all together and just go with Amazon.<br />So after getting it I in the end didn't return it. There wasn't a need. It was a solid purchase on my part for the money I spent. Plus when you buy from Amazon it comes directly to your door instead of having to drive somewhere and spending time finding the item in a store. Time is money friends! But I digress.<br /><br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00RY8F8Y4<br /><br />Best balance of quality and price. For what this product offers it's really hard to beat the price that you're going to pay for. I did a lot of searching but eventually made this purchase and I can tell you that for me it was the right choice!<br /><br />That's it, but if you want more than that, then you should be prepared and willing to spend a lot more on something else.<br /><br />I am very happy with my purchase. It was a worthy upgrade from other similar things I've been using! If you're smart you'll check out the:<br /><br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00TVO38F0<br />&#34;

I love spending time outdoors and doing Crossfit. Needed something sturdy to hold my food, and something that would not leak in rugged environments such as hiking, mountain biking, etc. Immediately after receiving this product, I took it in my backpack while mountain biking. It got thrashed around pretty good. However, the seal on this bad boy is amazing and nothing leaked out even a little bit. It cleaned up easily and didn't take up a whole lot of space while carrying it--the container is actually very slim. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is active like me, or is just looking for a good everyday lunch container to take to work.

I love Tim Ferriss' book and it really shed light on some simple things that can be done to lose weight. Tim stresses that you need to avoid white carbs, eat the same few meals over and over, don't drink calorie laden drinks, don't eat sugars and take one day off per week. The book also recommends the PAGG supplement system which is pretty good. I have used the Dr. Oz recommended supplement Slenderfruit-7 [[ASIN:B00IWV0AUO Slenderfruit-7 weight loss and appetite suppression diet pills]] and have had dramatic weight loss in using Tim's diet guidelines and this product.

This yellow bag is a lifesaver for all my gadgets. This has helped me so much over the summer! Don't you hate when you go to the pool and when you go to change your clothes you find they have gotten wet somehow. Well, this has definitely eliminated that problem here at our house. I also love knowing that my cell phone is not going to wet while we are there. The only issue I had with this is things do get quite hot in these bags. Either way, I always end up with wet items, including water shoes. Now I can carry everything out without getting all else in my duffel bag wet. I'm glad I found this type of item on Amazon.

This is an excellent bike pump with gauge! I have tried it on both my mountain, and road bikes. The bike pump is a nice size, but you don't sacrifice efficiency because it shifts air into the tire when you push the handle in and out. I have used it to completely re-inflate one of the 29&#34; tires on my mountain bike. It didn't take any time at all and I wasn't burned up at the end of it. The pump itself is a sturdy, well thought out, and constructed design. The mounting bracket works very well, even if you have bottle cages. I'd highly recommend this pump if you do any kind of cycling.

This dimmer cord helps for those lamps which don't dim on their own and one does not have a dimmer wall switch.<br /><br />My friend has one of these:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0000DI241/<br /><br /> I have about five of these in my home. All have worked well with no problems over the years. However, there is one thing that I would strongly point out. Not all of these dimmer cords have a light on the dimmer box. I accidently got one without the light and it makes it difficult to find in the dark. The light is turned on at the dimmer box and if there is no light on the box to tell you where it is in the dark room, it can be hard to find. This problem is solved if one makes sure that the dimmer box has a small light on it. The second thing that needs to be mentioned is that the outlet plug (into which the lamp plug needs to be inserted) is oriented perpendicular to the wall. If one has a lamp which has a similar outlet plug then with that lamp plug inserted in the dimmer plug which is inserted into the wall, the whole plug component is sticking about 4-6 inches out from the wall. If the outlet plug is behind a bookcase or furniture, this can be a problem. Even with a lamp plug that is flat, it will stick out several inches. Make sure there is enough space between the wall outlet and what is covering this unsightly mix of plugs and cords.

This has by far been one of the best purchases I have ever made. These masks are RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME. It is very easy to put on the face and the mask is truly concentrated with all the essential and natural ingredients as described. It smells so good too, It doesn't mention about cucumber but it smells like it. Very refreshing on the face, I left it for 20 minutes as advised and I could already feel the cooling effect of it on my face...and that was even just the first time I tried it! When I took it off my face felt and looked super clean and refreshed. I may be exaggerating in this review but it's in all honesty.

We HIGHLY recommend looking, and even getting http://fave.co/1c3DqBk  This mobile is wonderful. I think the baby especially likes the projection. The first time we turned it on, our 2 month old smiled and smiled. The remote control is handy and I love that it plays for 20 minutes. I don't know how long the batteries will last, but it is so much better than the wind up kind I don't care. It was easy to install on the crib and is very secure. I wish there were more volume settings (it has two). Even on the loudest setting it is kinda quiet. I would definitely purchase this mobile again or buy it for other future mothers for a shower gift.  We had a wind up mobile before purchasing this one and hated it. THIS one  http://fave.co/1bKZMXr We just put batteries in it last night, and I am in love with it!! So here it is from baby's eye view. :)  The only downside: the tiny screwdrivers that are needed for assembly. I had to search through my husbands computer kit to find one that was small enough.

My fiancé and I got this book as a gift, because we decided we wanted his uncle to marry us. It is exactly what we needed! It covers everything, step-by-step, from choosing everything you want said at your ceremony, including vows, to extra special touches to add like a dove or butterfly release, to making it official and the paperwork and process. Another friend told me that they used the book to create their ceremony and then just gave it to the person they hired to marry them. Anyone wanting to have their wedding really reflect THEM and not the officiant or celebrant doing the wedding, should get this book and create a really special ceremony, something their guests will talk about long after the wedding.

Great quality lemon/lime squeezer. This thing works very well. We have an old plastic squeezer that we bought from the grocery store, and its just terrible and I'm afraid its going to break each time. So glad I got to try this one. It really looks and feels like it will hold up through anything and will squeeze most of the juice out of any fruit you put in there. This squeezer works great for smaller/medium sized lemons and limes. You can get much more juice out of the lemons than hand squeezing.  If your lemons are too big, you can even cut them in quarters to fit and them use the squeezer. This squeezer is durable and very easy to use.

After all, you only want what's best for your skin.<br />The Epique has a very light feeling to it once it is applied to your skin, has an amazing smell.<br />Most anti aging creams I have used in the past leave my face feeling sticky and feel like nothing is becoming of these high dollar creams.

So I am doing this review after using for a while and I have gotten some wonderful and surprising results on my face. I have a more youthful appearance and more elasticity. My face is a lot brighter, the redness and blotchy discolored areas are lightening up as well as under my eyes and neck. It just seemed to pull my complexion together into one.<br />I did have a deep line on my forehead that has been there for years, I never thought anything would help because it was extremely deep. Also, some lines around my mouth where they show when I smile. The line on my forehead is gradually decreasing in depth and less noticeable and the wrinkles around my mouth are getting firmer with each use.<br />Getting the right amount of the serum out is easy. The bottle has a dropper that I can get a few drops out at a time which is plenty enough for my entire face. Really generous size as well. I would definitely recommend this to others.

So far, great results.<br />I've been using Epique for about 6 months now and have seen definite improvements with my skin and the dryness. My skin tone looks more even and with less spots and blotches. The area around my lower cheekbones is more firm and has a lifted, tighter look.<br /><br />The bottle is an oz. Since using this I have barely used even 20% and that's with a twice a day application. It takes very little to moisturize with this and just a tiny amount will do in my opinion. It works well enough for just one pump.<br /><br />When applying to my face I did notice that it rubs in well and absorbs really quickly. It is not sticky nor does it leave a greasy feeling as some moisturizers do. I do not have many wrinkles though I did see improvement on my forehead where I have a deep line from a bad habit of squinting, it has faded a bit and is not so pronounced anymore.<br /><br />I didn't have any bad side effects or skin sensitivity with this or clogging of my pores. My face overall is smoother and soft after using this. I would recommend to other people based on my experience with it.

I'm 32 and unfortunately I'm starting to pay the price for not wearing sunscreen all those years. Now the wrinkles have started to creep up around my eyes, no attractive! I tried out a few high end eye treatments over the past year but always found them to be too thick and some left an unwanted residue which didn't look smooth under my day makeup. So happy I found Dermarie because it seriously goes on so smooth and I noticed a difference not only in the fine lines put the puffiness, which has definitely helped me eliminate those &#34;oh you look tired&#34; comments I was getting from my co workers and friends. The cream works wonders for brightening your eyes. You won't be disappointed in the eye cream... I highly recommend it!<br /><br />The eye serum I bought after using the eye cream and being very satisfied with the results. The serum is not gooey, like other night serums I've used in the past. I've always woken up with puffy eyes my whole life...this product has definitely helped eliminate my morning puffiness and helped with some of those wrinkles/crows feet that have been creeping up with age too. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an all in one eye treatment...very satisfied!<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that I've been buying the two products separately and wish I would of known about the set to save a few bucks. Aside from that I highly recommend this eye therapy set. You won't be disappointed!

In order to not void the warranty, you are required to install a filter between your water source and the pump, I elected to buy the Shurflo 1/2&#34; twist on pipe Strainer from the same vendor. For the price, this pump does exactly what it's supposed to do. I set up a domestic water system in my cottage. I collect rain water in a large 87 gallon rain barrel, then pump it through a couple of filters into a second barrel. When setting this up and testing, there was a shortage of rain (naturally!) so I filled it with a home garden hose. As the first tank filled, I activated the pump to send this water through the filters into the second tank. I was shocked to find that the regular house water system could not keep up with flow generated by the Flojet! With the system all set up and running, I have better water pressure in my primitive abode than I used to have in a normal house.

I bought this because of its cool picture. This mouse works really great, its easy to plug in and fits your hand so perfectly.  Everything lights up and had no real problems at all. The quality of the product is good  and the controls are accurate.<br /> People always comment on it when they see it. I can use it for a very long time without any problems. I would probably buy two more for my nephews.

My husband received this from a colleague for Christmas, and it's been a wonderful gift! He's always got a mustache/beard combo going and has been using regular scissors and a manual razor for daily upkeep. This tool just keeps it all convenient with one gadget instead of five, and we can even use it on his hair! It's built really well, too, so you know it'll last for awhile. Norelco is a good brand we've used before - the quality of this grooming system is just what I'd expect from them. Definitely a good investment!

This tea is quite good and when you add to the fact that it also provides a nice burst of energy, you have yourself a winning green tea in my book.  I usually drink it cold, although it tastes good hot too.  I drink tea daily, mostly for the taste and energy, but I am always happy to add antioxidants to the body whenever I can.<br /><br />I will also drink black tea which usually has a higher caffeine content for energy; [[ASIN:B00IDXDQ9I All Natural Organic - High Energy Caffeine Instant Black Tea Powder (Over 100 Servings Per Package) - Buy One Get One Free!]].  I do like the taste of the green tea better, but when it comes to using it as a source of energy, black tea still performs better for me.  This is also probably due to the fact that the instant black tea powder I use doesn't come in bags so it is easier to make a "strong" cup.  I will usually fill a large water bottle (about a quart) and add two heaping teaspoons of the tea powder, and sip throughout the day.  This works out to be a ton of caffeine but it keeps me wired like no other.<br /><br />This is why I like this green tea that comes with the ginseng so much.  It is not sooo much caffeine and I am using another source of energy besides just the caffeine content.  The ginseng, I'm sure, is what makes it so much more expensive but since I do not drink it every day, I think it is not that bad.

All my life I have made coffee with a drip machine or K Cups. When my Son came home from school he brought home a French Press. I could not believe how much better the coffee tasted. I needed my own.<br />This ZYK French press is easy to use and easy to clean. I love the coffee. It has a stainless steel screen system so that no grinds get into your coffee cup. It also is great for tea.<br />There is no better and easier way to make coffee. This is the way coffee is suppose to taste.

Lots of people have enjoyed the Annapurna Circuit using this guidebook, which is a well established successful independent guidebook, written by a trekker for trekkers. The mountains and views have not moved since the original research trek, nor have the villages, the GPS locations are the same, the distance between the villages is the same, the cultural descriptions are still accurate, the mountaineering history has not changed much. The prices have changed, but that's inflation for you! The lodge menus will have changed, I expect for the better. There is now a road to Chamje and from Muktinath, but you don't have to get on the bus if you don't want to.<br /><br />The guidebook is printed by Amazon for each order, it's called "print on demand" and it enables high quality independent publishers to compete with big publishers, like you-know-who. This Annapurna guidebook has been praised since it was first published and is a great way to plan your trek.<br /><br />All I can say in conclusion is get off your computer and go do the trek. It's the experience of a lifetime, and this guidebook will help you along the way, and help you have some fun too.<br /><br />Ian Johnson<br />ianpjohnson@yahoo.com

When you enter the world of Ken Frazier and Sam Flagg, you never know what to expect.  In this tale, J.T. Prescott has masterfully succeeded in dispelling misperceptions often held about those within the retirement generation.  When retired seniors Ken, Craig and Bill invite the more youthful and physically capable Sam Flagg into their circle of trust, they band together and use their collective &#34;arts and crafts&#34; and set out on a dangerous mission to uncover a government conspiracy that involves killing an untold number of unsuspecting american people.  The supporting characters are really developed and well written. You can certainly expect exciting action scenes with unexpected twists and turns along the journey.  This is an entertaining and interesting read. Arts and Crafts has an underlying topic that left me with a feeling of hope and a renewed respect and admiration for a sometimes overlooked retirement aged population.  I was reminded about the special knowledge and wisdom that can only be taught by those who have a lifetime of experiences to share.  Looking forward to a sequel.........

The Youth Express Eye Gel is a great product for under eye puffiness and even dark circles. The recommended use is twice daily, so I use it in the morning and again before bed time. It's very hydrating and can be used on your cheeks and forehead as well to moisturize the skin and improve skin tone and texture. Just using it under my eyes makes me feel and look better, because let's face it...no one wants to have eye bags or crows feet. Right? Great product for those of us concerned with aging gracefully!

I've had mine for a few months and it is still working like new. Its very functional. The back lit screen is a wonderful feature especially for such an affordable gauge. Easy to read, simple to use, seals well, and the auto shut-off is nice for conserving the battery which is potentially the only down side as it costs as much as the gauge to replace. Great buy for anyone who wants a simple digital gauge. This gauge is great and extremely dependable.

I don't know what is special about this brush but it works! I have very thick curly hair. It tangles very easily and I have to brush my hair before I wash it otherwise I will not be able to get it untangled after I wash it. I ordered this and I tried it immediately on my dry hair, that had been brushed earlier, and the brush went through with ease and the bristles did not get caught and pull my hair hard at all. It is painless and quick! I cannot say enough about this! It is awesome.

I recently purchased the "HESI A2 Secrets Study Guide" which is the companion product to this flashcard study system and I have to say that I am really glad I purchased both. These flash cards act as a great way for me to quickly and effectively learn for the exam, getting me in "fighting shape" for the big test I have coming up in about a week.<br /><br />The flashcards are filled with countless subjects of questions and answers for everything you will need to know to really ace the HESI A2 exam. From biology to chemistry, mathematics, grammar, nouns, ideal gas law, thyroid hormones and so much more. I've been having my roommate test me routinely throughout the day, even when I'm not officially studying, to get me ready for answering questions on the fly and really making sure that I have material as memorized and understood as much as possible, and I don't think I would be half as ready as I am without these little flashcards at my disposal.<br /><br />Combined with the "HESI A2 Secrets Study Guide", this flashcard study system really is your best better to properly study and past the test with flying colors. I've only had about a week and a half to study for this exam and I have about a week left, but I am totally confident that I have this exam in the bag and will be able to really continue my goal as a nurse.

I am a coffee addict. I drink coffee from the moment I wake until the moment I go to sleep. Pretty much everyone in my family is addicted. When my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter sees a mug or cup in a book she says coffee with a big smile. Even though we don't allow her to drink it yet she knows what it is. I like trying new ways of making coffee and having it quick so when I could get this French press at a great price of course I had to. And since I love it so much I wanted to share my thoughts on it. First off it is very pretty. It's is a coffee pot that doesn't take much room and I don't have to hide away. I like that I don't need filters with it because I have accidentally ran out before and almost died when I did. It doesn't take a lot of coffee to fill it up and I can control the strength. It is easy to use also. I highly recommend this to everyone who drinks coffee.

This is a great conditioning mascara! I have short and very light eyelashes and I have tried every conditioner out there to try and make them grow longer. This product actually worked, and I can see a difference after using it for around a month every day. It doesn't smudge or give me panda eyes, yet it washes off easily. It's consistency is perfect, it applies smoothly and doesn't clump my eyelashes together. One or two layers is sufficient to ensure full coverage. I wear contact lenses and this mascara is perfect - I haven't had any problems with eye irritation. This is the best conditioning mascara I have ever tried and I am very happy with the purchase! Five star product!

The cover actually has a very thick and strong quality to it. I have been using this cover for the last 6 months and there have been some insane sandstorms in the area but the cover still holds perfectly. This is the kind of product that you can recommend to others with complete confidence that it will perform as required. If you have a grill this is the best way to protect it.

First Impression - This TV looks nice. Clean front. It is extremely light. The base feels sturdy and big enough to support the TV without risk of falling over. It was simple to put together with 8 screws in the base.<br /><br />Just for some background, I'm upgrading from an old  http://fave.co/1bQLeWR  in the bedroom. I do have an HDTV in the living room, but it is also a Tube TV. There I have a  http://fave.co/1bAFXCb  TV that I bought about 7 years ago that was basically the biggest widescreen Tube TV made that I know of. Back then a Tube TV picture was much better and cheaper than Flat Panel.<br /><br />Setup - It has 2 HDMI's and then some regular RCA and Component hookups. My setup consists of Verizon FIOS Cable Box and a WD Live TV Media Player (to be replaced by a Boxee Box within the week, but that's another story). Plugged the Cable Box and the Media Player into each HDMI port using new Amazon Basics HDMI cables. The TV on-screen setup was easy enough to figure out without pulling out the instruction manual. Everything came up perfectly the first time with just a press of the Source button.<br /><br />Picture Quality - I tested the TV out with several different types of media and sources.<br />1) First with SD Cable. A little blocky up close, which may just be the source, but from a normal viewing distance, I the quality was just fine. The kids' cartoons were fine.<br />2) Second with HD Cable. This picture seemed really nice. Didn't see any kind of distortion. Seemed nearly as good as the HD Tube TV that I have downstairs from an 8 foot viewing distance. I was happy with what I saw.<br />3) Third with a normal 720p Video file via the Media Player. Picture was really nice in this case also. Everything seemed crisp. Very happy.<br />4) Finally with a fast motion 1080p Video file via the Media Player. This is where I expected the worst, but to my surprise, the fast motion scenes seemed fine also. I only tested a couple of files, so we'll see if other sceneshave a problem, but so far so good.<br /><br />Overall I was very happy with the picture quality. The colors on the default setting were pretty terrible, so I tried the presets and settled &#34;Dynamic&#34; Picture Mode and Cool Color Tone in the Picture Options setting which was pretty much perfect in all instances. Looked pretty natural with nice colors.<br /><br />Viewing Angles - Side viewing angles seemed really good. This was one of my pet peeves and most of my reluctance to move to a flat panel TV in the first place. Many flat panel TV's look terrible when you aren't watching it straight on. This TV seems to have much better side viewing than many of the competing TV's out there.<br /><br />Screen - The screen edges do have a few very faint white areas that I have noticed, but they are barely noticeable and only when the screen is completely black. I don't notice it at all when there is any kind of picture on the screen. I probably only see it because I am looking for it after reading a few comments about backlight bleed. For me, it doesn't seem like anything to worry about. I always buy SquareTrade warranties with all my electronics, so if the screen does have a problem, I will be set.<br /><br />Sound Quality - This is where I had the most trouble. Granted, I'm upgrading from a old TV, but out of the box, the Samsung sounded very hollow and words were hard to understand. It seemed to be completely missing any low end, not talking about booming bass, just lower frequencies seemed to be missing. I tried every sound preset that they had and all were pretty bad. I finally gave up on the presets and used the included 5 band Equalizer which finally did the trick. Per request, I posted a picture of the settings in the customer images section of this item. [THIS SECTION HAS BEEN UPDATED BELOW: I basically maxed out the low and high frequencies and made a bell curve of the middle frequencies, raising the one that controlled voices until I has happy. This seemed to do the trick just fine and I am now happy with the sound.] Granted, if you are expecting a booming surround sound feel, you're shopping for the wrong TV, but for what I think this TV is meant for, it sounds just fine.<br /><br />Bells, Whistles and Other Stuff - I haven't toyed with this TV too much yet. There are lots of menu settings to go through. The power button on the bottom of the TV seems pretty cool. It is like a combined button/joystick that pulls up a menu when pressed that you can use the button to move through, or just turn off the TV. I won't use it much since the Cable Box remote will do most of the work, but it is a nice to have since the actual TV remote will probably sit in a drawer once everything is set up. It does have a USB port that is supposed to play pretty much any type of media format. If this works well, it is a great feature. For me, I plan on continuing to use a dedicated Media Player, so I probably won't use this much, but for anyone else, it would save you $100 on having to buy a media player if you have a use for it.<br /><br />I've only had this TV for one day, but this is what I think so far for a pro/con list.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Energy Star cost of $6-$12 per year to operate. That just sounds crazy, but I'll take it.<br />2) Great picture quality, especially for the price.<br />3) Very good side viewing angles.<br />4) Easy setup and connection to Cable Box and Media Player.<br />5) Enough picture and sound settings to get the quality you want for your individual preference.<br />6) Fast motion scenes seem ok so far.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Sound presets are terrible, but can be adjusted manually.

If you need to know if anybody is coming up the driveway this is ideal. Being all battery operated the detector can be mounted anywhere with a clear line of sight across the driveway and the receiver I am amazed to find can be mounted up to 80 metres away. Yes there will always be false alarms as cats and even birds can trigger it but an excellent device which works well and gives early warning of anybody coming into your property. I also like that the volume of the alarm can be set to high or low depending where you mount it.

Apart from its solar feature, the power bank can be charged conventionally from a USB source via its built in Micro-USB socket using the USB lead supplied. Other features include dual USB outputs (one delivers 1A, the other 2.1A 5V), a four LED charge indicator, built-in emergency torch and extensive intelligent protection system against short circuits and over-current etc. The USB cable supplied also doubles to connect the full size USB output ports of the power bank to most smartphones, satnavs and cameras etc. however, I always use the original lead supplied with the device I want to charge. Apple users will need to supply their own charger cable.

Excuse me, the reason they have the FREEDOM to attend a collage is because these young men lay down their lives to fight for our countries freedom.

I had purchased another DVD player on amazon but it died and I had to return it. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ANVQWU?tag=a9000-20  After doing some research I came across this one! Features include the usual gamut plus a very nice speed-control which I've never seen on a DVD player (but then I'm not an aficionado so what do I know ha ha). Simply pressing that particular button on the remote allows one to speed up or slow down playback with FULL sound! Really cool. I'm going to like this button for chick flicks! (Shhh ... you didn't hear me say that!) LoL  It's also half the size of the now-deceased DVD player so I recovered some shelf space as well. Sweet.  I'll update this if there are any untoward events but my experience with Sony gear (going back to before the Walkman) has always been excellent. Hopefully this is an aspect of Akio's company that lives on.  I recommend you pick up one of these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00THLNVY0?tag=a9000-20  I hope this review was helpful. Ciao.

Take what you need from it, building on weak areas first in order to get the most out of your study time.<br /><br />This set is excellent to share with a friend or two. It may be possible for you to start a small study group with people you trust to help you get some of the studying done.

We would all appreciate a day at the spa and being pampered but for me that's  just not an option. Even though I can't afford to be pampered by professionals, I can get the same spa treatments at home. I purchased the Dead Sea Mud Mask from InstaNatural recently and have not only used it on my own skin, but shared with my daughter. Her face tends to break out so she was in need of some deep cleansing...the Dead Sea Mud Mask was just the thing! Her face was immediately clear of blackheads and her pimples were significantly diminished. Wow! I've used it as well and have seen great results. My skin is clearer, smoother and my fine lines are not nearly as noticeable. This is not only a great skin care product, but also awesome as an anti-aging product.

These were just what I need to label my jars and other kitchen things. I like that they are removable. Even after pulling it off one thing and re-sticking it to another, it worked well and adhered. I used a cheapy chalkboard marker and it looked fine. I think a better quality one would have given it a more &#34;chalkboard look&#34;. The thing is, these are PVC... so you do get that sense that they are more plastic like labels, than matte chalkboard. But nonetheless - they are labels and they do what they are supposed to do.

I couldn't put down this fast-paced, honest, young-at-heart memoir. The characters are as real in this story as I'm sure they are in the author's experience. Their portrayal reminded me of the characters from my own travels and the characters in my current classroom; most importantly, they evoked real emotion.<br /><br />Frustration, pride, loneliness, disappointment, and elation are feelings that I believe anyone who has traveled or taught can relate to. These are circumstances of so much good and so much unknown. While reading Abbey's story, I felt 23 again--I remembered the realization that teaching was way more then theory--I remembered feeling so hopelessly out of place in a foreign country that I wanted to disappear--I remembered the freedom that comes with embarking on an adventure--and I remembered how often the resolutions of change come throughout a lifetime.<br /><br />It's hard to graduate college and find your place in a grown up world. It's hard to move away from home. It's hard to know yourself well enough to predict where you will be at the end of every road. This book a story of teaching and partying in a small village in Taiwan, but it's really a story of friendship, patience, and the best time ever.

I told the Samsung rep on the phone. He just said it was out of warranty, so long story short I decided against another Samsung.  The vizio rep happened to be there and he pointed out that they re-vamped all the smart apps and told me of the new back-lit 12 panel led zone, which even the 2013 high tech &#34;M&#34; series didn't have. After fiddling with the contrast and temp colors I was able to get a fantastic picture.Bought it, brought it home and set it up.Wow! I was pretty impressed to find a $700 TV that can go up against a $1500 TV. And then you toss in a referbished TV for $500 and you've got yourself a deal! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSG0AJO  Vizio also now has a smaller front frame edge measureing 10mm. only 2 mm less than last year but it makes for an almost invisable frame. Another bonus... I had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B000WYVBR0  I did a solid week of reading reviews and numerous visits to my local stores watching and adjusting several brands before deciding on a 55 inch LG or Vizio as my choices. I hated the new LG's magic remote( works like a mouse on the screen) but I also heard that the Vizio had lame apps on their smart E & the better M series.  Just last week I walked into my local &#34;S&#34; club and a guy was setting up the new 2014 E series B-2. He told me they were the first to get them.  Vizio ups the speaker wattage from 10 to 15 watts. Not mindblowing but way improved from the muffled speaker sound that is associated with most down pointed speakers that seems to be standard with most HGTV's. Bottom line I love it. Its good to see a company like Vizio upping their game with internal improvements instead of a cosmetic makeover like a lot of other companies.  Save some cash, get yourself a good as new TV! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSG0AJO

The OXO Good Grips 3-in-1 Avocado Slicer, Green works very well as advertised.  It works well with this: http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B0088LR592/  The blade easily halves the avocado, making it equal to any sharp knife in the drawer. The pit remover is actually easier to use than a sharp knife - I've always slapped the knife blade into the seed & twisted, but then I have to pull the seed off the blade. I've never felt quite comfortable slamming a knife blade into the seed, or slicing the meat toward my hand -it goes against everything I was taught about cutting toward my skin with a sharp knife.   The Good Grips tool provides a much safer way to prepare avocados. I've owned several avocado slicers which had wire cutters, and the wires always sprung rending the tool useless. The slicing strips of the Good Grips slicer are sturdy plastic, cutting and scooping easily and cleanly through both large and small avocados.   On very ripe, soft avocado meat I've had to help the last little bit through the tool by pushing on the end of the avocado peel, but this is a minor thing. The tool fits comfortably in large or small hands; it certainly speeds up the preparation of avocados and is a clean way to prepare them; and it washes up easily. I'm glad I have it, and I recommend it.  I hope this review was helpful!

Exactly what i was looking for and love the way it looks, easy set up,  and so far.it's working perfectly! Audio is very clear and connects to the phone right away when i turn on the car. I was able to find a station to sync it to and I haven't had to change the channel, even when driving an hour or to out of town.i also use this device to talk hands-free on my phone and also use it to connect to any Bluetooth-enabled device.  And  even i  use it to charge my phone or player while streaming audio.<br />If you spend a lot of time in your car, if you enjoy quality sound in your car, if you listen to audio books or your favorite music, then this transmitter is a must. I'm really amazed and will continue to use it happily when I travel.Really  overall great product. would recommended to every one

First of all, if you travel a lot and are looking for a lightweight and simple charger this is definitely the key. Even if you charge a lot of USB devices at home, these are still nice to have in every room.<br /><br />Qicent's Dual USB Wall Charger is a solid charger that plugs directly into the wall. It's a one piece charger and looks great plugged in. There are two ports with each having a different ampage. The top one is rated at 2.4A/5V and is designed for charging tablets and larger devices while the bottom one is rated at 1.5A/5V and is designed for charging smartphones and smaller devices.<br /><br />There is a blue indicator light that lets you know when the charger is plugged in correctly and pulling power. This is nice because sometimes I don't push my chargers in all the way, plus they are easy to see in the dark. Overall, its an excellent charger. This charger only includes the charger, there are no extra cables included. There is also a 24 month warranty that comes with this purchase so you know you are covered if you have any problems.

I have been wanting to go to Thailand and Vietnam for a long time, so when these Lonely Planet books, [[ASIN:1741797144 Thailand]] and [[ASIN:1741797152 Vietnam]] became available I had to get them. Lonely Planet really gets into a country in their guides. The don't fill their pages with glossy color photos, though a few would be nice, instead their pages are full of information.<br /><br />They have maps to everywhere you'd want to go in a country. They do the cities justice as well as the countryside. They do the markets and the beaches, the churches and the museums, the bike trails and the footpaths.<br /><br />I believe a trip to Thailand should include a side tour to Vietnam, at least mine is going to, so both books are a necessity to me. The book on Thailand is over 800 pages and its writers write as if they've lived there, as if they really know the country. A different group of writers have written the Vietnam book and that surprised me, because I though some of them would have worked on both books. Nevertheless, though it's 250 pages shorter than the Thailand book, the book on Vietnam is equally as well written.<br /><br />I should say that the print in these books is on the smallish side, but I suppose to make it any larger they'd have to have so many pagers that the books would be unwieldy, especially the Thailand book.<br /><br />I've always looked at Lonely Planet as catering to a different kind of clientele than Frommor's or Fodor's. Those two companies seem to cater more toward the traveler who has more to spend, who will more than likely stay in the more expensive hotels. Sure you'll find the expensive hotels in Lonely Planet as well, but you'll find a myriad of less expensive alternatives. I believe you get more information about a country from Lonely Planet and I'm looking forward to going to Thailand and Vietnam and having Lonely Planet show me the way.

We had a need for a device like this. And we tried some other products, each has some problems. This has everything we could ever ask for...<br />There should be no reason for anyone to give anything less than 5 stars BUT I believe Munchkin has a few bad production batches.. As a result, some people have received lemons...Their devices did not survive for more than a month.<br /><br />I think, you should go ahead and buy it. If you have any problems, Amazon is here to support..<br /><br />Not so great features:<br />- Sound quality is not crisp, but considering you are just listening to "noise" it does not matter...They had to keep the cost low..<br />- Hard to find the buttons in dark..<br /><br />Great Features:<br />- This has a projector that you can use on the wall or ceiling... You can even change slides, for different graphics....Monkeys are fun.<br /><br />- Different sounds available.. Most people would prefer white noise, but you have options..<br /><br />- There is a timer.. And also there is voice activation.. If there is any noise, white noise comes back..<br /><br />If this unit breaks down, I wouldn't hesitate to a new one..<br /><br />Update:<br />Still going strong. Dependable.

I have never been a huge fan of coconut water until my friend recommended me to try out Cocozia and let me tell you, this is the real deal. I have tried several other brands of coconut water before but I must say, Cocozia really changed my opinion. Not only is it refreshing and tasty but it also comes in perfect packaging making it easy for me to toss in my gym bag on the way out the door. It is also 100% organic and Kosher which is a big deal to me. It also contains a natural abundance of potassium and magnesium, as well as other electrolytes. For anyone skeptical of trying out Cocozia I highly recommend you do - this is the best out there.

Rolls over the Dough like a dream! My dough did not bubble at all! We made homemade pizza to try it out and it was a success! Easy to handle and does the job perfectly! Wasn't hard to clean just rinsed in hot water but make sure you rinse right after use so none of the dough hardens on the spikes and it will be simple clean up!

Its like heaven its like when you use it at the very top of your head and scalp it sends tingles down you spine, I know that sounds so weird, but it is a good therapeutic wonderful relaxing feeling each time the brush hits your scalp and head.  I have thick long hair, and part of that means I have to take extra effort to keep it healthy and par of that means a goo brush.  brushing when you have long hair is a must, it helps distribute the natural oils into ones hair and scalp. This is a good brush for doing that  I like how the brush is shaped and fits good into ones hands. Im glad I now have it among my hair tools.

This is an amazing thermometer. We manage a Bed & Breakfast Inn. For a winter special we cook a 7-course Chef Tasting Menu. We use the Infrared Gun for testing our oil before adding the shrimp. A switch inside the battery compartment (9volt) allows you to switch off the laser sight, which will prolong battery life. My use does not require the aim of the laser so it is VERY nice. Seems quite accurate. We also test the temperatures throughout the Inn - especially near all doors to make sure our floors are at an appropriate and comfortable temperature for our guests. Highly recommended!

After reading every router review on Amazon... I came to the conclusion that I just needed a simple router for my iPad and iPhone to connect with. All other devices in the home are CAT6. I plugged this device in and looked on the bottom for the router IP, Login and Password and within 5 minutes I have it configured and by using the same name and password for wireless from my old router the Apple products did not know the difference. The range covers the whole house and outside and I could not be happier. Even if this unit dies within 6 months it is still cheaper than other big name brands.

This tablet is a little expensive. But the deal is extremely worthy because this tablet is packed with many useful and upgraded features. First thing is the extra-large display. It is 10" and better than an ordinary 7" display. Front camera is 8MP. Pictures and videos are excellent and video calls are so clear and HD. To support this feature, this tablet PC is 4G enabled. 4G is better speed than a 3G connectivity. 4G transfers data extremely faster. Processor is also high speed and dual core. Graphic card also performs faster and support many high level 3D games.  This tablet also uses one of the advanced batteries as the primary energy source. It can keep the tab alive for long long hours. Hrd disk is 16GB. Is 16GB enough? Well if you are a downloader and a movie lover that capacity is not even nearly enough. Alternative is a expanding of memory using a micro SD memory card. I use [[ASIN:B00D1FXX96 New 32gb Micro Sd Card Sdhc Tf Flash Memory Card 32gb Class 10, New! Usa!]]. It is my favourite because it is trouble less and reliable.

I bought two of these at Christmas for my 7 yr old son and 8 yr old daughter. I followed the directions, carefully charging them all the way up, discharging all the way down, several times, while loading a bunch of games, music apps, and wall paper onto each of them. I put a screen protectors on them and bought a TabSuit leather cases for protection. The gaming is impressive, due to the internal gyroscope/accelerometer, one can play Angry Birds GO! as well as Driving games, by steering/turning the tablet. The sound is about what you'd expect from a small device, but with ear phones is great. With heavy graphics & gaming, the battery lasts about 3-4 hours, and on stand-by or with music, the battery lasts days. No problems with Wi Fi, no problems with the display. The tablet has been working perfectly for a month with near daily use.

I have tried to tell him that he needs to change things up, maybe use some Facebook ads or maybe set up a Twitter account. He will not listen.

I tried one of these at my friend's house and was pleasantly surprised how well it works. Theirs was made in Japan and they had to hire someone to install. The BIDET4ME E-300Al was very simple to install. Also the shape of this model was aesthetically pleasing to the eye compared to their model which is used in nursing homes. It appeared thinner and sleeker.<br /><br />Very Easy to controls and use. Setting on warm temperature, and width of stream very convenient. I opted for the model over the 350 because I wanted the dryer function, which works well enough, but I find myself sitting up before the dryer time is up and using paper.<br /><br />This is very worthwhile purchase.

She was fine while we were home with her, however I had my neighbors complaining that she barked non-stop while we were at work. Purchased this collar and problem solved! It only took her a few days of wearing it for a few hours a day. She still barks but nowhere near the amount she used to. And, best of all, my neighbors are now happy! They said they can't hear her barking anymore when we aren't home! Amazing product at an awesome cheap price !

Fits perfectly with my  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B006Z2BZBU  We had some thicker flannel ones but I wanted to get some lighter cotton ones for the warmer months and to take to daycare for DD's cot, and these are perfect. They are very soft and lightweight. I purchased the mint and the pink geometic dots. I will definitely be purchasing more in the near future!  I was unsure about buying these because we've tried other brands of crib sheets that do not fit DD's mattress, even though its a standard size. I decided to try them because the price was low enough to where I wouldn't be upset if they ended up not fitting after all. Luckily these do fit perfectly even after washing and drying several times.  ---------  After using these sheets for several months now I've decided to come back and review again.  In all those washings the colors on these have not faded, there are no holes, and the elastic is still working great. The same cannot be said of the other brands of sheets we have tried which we have purchased from both Babies R Us and Target. I will definitely be buying more!  These sheets are great! I change my daughter's sheets two or three times a week on average, and I only have 5 sheets that fit her bed, so they get washed A LOT.

We were not sure if this whistle could work but we went for it since it was being offered at a fair price compared to the other brands. Any time we could hear them bark, i could blow the whistle so loud and they could stop barking ( i don't know how it worked). It seems as if they have been scared because we don't hear them often.

I get some on my hands and rub it through her hair. Then, I get some more on my hands and and twist small sections of her hair around my fingers to bring out the curls. Then, I scrunch her hair from the bottom for even more curl. It is so much fun. She loves having her hair fussed over. Plus,  I really love that it is not heavy on her hair, so even if I use a lot, it does not make her hair look greasy. It smells good as well which we love.

I have been in the process of growing out my hair, I took clippers to my hair back in January of 2014. Yeah, don't ask.<br /><br />I have been taking this for a couple weeks now to see just how it would work for me. First, let me just say yes it does work. I had to get two trims at the nape of my neck since using this product.<br /><br />Because this does grow hair, it truly grows it everywhere. I have also noticed other body hair growing quite faster than normal. I have to pluck my eye brows more, and have to shave my legs more frequently as well. So just be aware that this does target hair growth... all hair.<br /><br />These are very easy to take, about the size of a normal vitamin pill. The smell is a soft vanilla with no aftertaste.<br /><br />I am still currently taking these, and I am enjoying the results that so far I have been given.

This a great book for teen fiction lovers. There's a little bit of everything, romance, heartbreak, and all the drama of high school. It's a great book to read when your in your early high school years so that you can learn some valuable lessons from the characters in the book. Maybe if you don't want to listen to your parents experiences you'll listen to what these characters go through trying to get around the popularity contests, boyfriend stealers, and fake friends. This book has a lot of ups and downs leaving the reader wondering if it will be a happy ending or one of those books that like to go by “Reality”. Not to give spoilers, but I hate the endings that don't match the ending that I wanted while reading.

I use this as my night cream now and WOW. What a change! My skin feels like it has been just moisturized when I wake up. Use during the day for my neck/chest. I'm so hooked on this brand. This is one of the few antiaging products I can use (no nut oils or super active ingredients). Highly suggest for sensitive skin.<br /><br />Things I have noticed:<br />- more even skin tone<br />- moisture!!! (I live in the desert, my skin flakes non stop)<br />- radiance<br />- the smell (nice mint)<br />- NO BREAKOUTS (this is a VERY big issue for me and lotions/moisturizers)

With this product, it came in a large round jar. Upon opening it the first thing that hit me was the aroma. It has a menthol kind of smell to it that I think is amazing. When applied, it has a cool sensation that feels nice and the gel-cream is neither too thick or too think, it has a perfect consistency that smooths on nicely. I like the way it feels going onto my skin and how quickly it absorbs. I hate getting creams, lotions, make-up, deodorant or anything like that on my clothes when getting dressed. I have been using the body merry line for about a week and a half and this cellulite gel-cream seems to be working well. I am not rid of all my bumps and lumps yet, but they do seem to be fading a little everyday.

Your Soul's Companion is an excellent resource, containing many well thought out exercises and guidance for those seeking to find their path in life. Sprinkled throughout with fascinating anecdotes from Wendy's life as a medical intuitive and healer, the blend of spiritual practices described in this book are readily accessible and adaptable for anyone questioning their place in humanity but unsatisfied with the answers provided by mainstream religion. I highly recommend this book for its clarity, its comprehensiveness, and its message of personal and spiritual growth.

Need to find a good set of flashcards? Look no further. The authors of this set took the time ti really summarize and explain the material so even though it's more condensed you get the same level of understanding you would from a traditional guide - I'd argue even clearer understanding. And the best part about them is if you want to study on your commute there's no extra weight to carry because the cards are relatively small and virtually weightless.

We purchased one of these to take care of our hell-spawn (raccoon) problem. The coons were digging up the yard, eating new plants, and searching for grubs. They left piles of dirt on the walkway and destruction in their wake. We purchased a battery of these scarcrow things and lined them up to create a critter-free zone and voila! No more eviscerated plants, no more dirt piles, no more coons! Its expensive, but worth it.<br /><br />The crow even works on dumb humans, like me! =-) I came home late at night from the movies and found quite a surprise when my sister turned this thing on forgetting I was still out. The scarecrow got me. Repeatedly. And I deserved it.<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't forget to turn it off or the UPS man won't like you very much.<br /><br />Awesome. Worth every penny.

This is a great alarm system that helps me keep my family safe. The Senors are really good quality and they WILL detect even the slightest movement. The system is relatively easy to set up and use. No wiring is necessary as all window and door contacts, motion detectors and key fobs are remote. The main panel can handle more units and sensors than would be needed in an average size house.

The batteries arrived as advertised completely pre-charged. They replaced Energizers (model NH15BP4) that couldn't hold a charge for more than a day (which is standard for Energizer rechargeables... just read the reviews).<br /><br />However, these Amazon batteries caused our Canon SX110 digital camera to malfunction. The lens would not autofocus. I searched online and read digital cameras can be picky about batteries. We tried other batteries in the camera later that day and it worked perfectly. I checked the Amazon batteries on a La Crosse Technology BC-700, which I highly recommend, and they were fine. I'm chalking it up to the Canon is just picky. Aside from that one hiccup, these batteries are amazing when it comes to holding a charge.<br /><br />I'm using them primarily in my Uniden scanner and they work great.<br /><br />I'll try to update this review in the future.

Best face moisturizer I've been able to find so far. Makes my skin baby butt smooth, has helped clear up any minor breakouts I've had and most importantly, didn't break me out or make me oily. Don't bother wasting money on the expensive department store type marula oil. They are chock full of chemicals and silicone( this is what makes you're skin feel smooth in those products, and also clogs the crap out of your pores) this oil is very light, doesn't have an unpleasant odor like some other oils I've used (hemp seed oil works great but smells hideous) and in a pinch one pump will moisturize your hands like they have never been moisturized before. Seriously cannot say enough good things about this product.

After using this back shaver for some time now I decided to give a great demonstration on how the shaver works.  The baKblade is definitely set apart from the other back shavers for multiple reason.  First, the baKblade has a larger blade that covers so much ground when shaving you are literally done in less than a minute.  The shave actually feels great and because of the way the shaving blades are arranged it's impossible to cut your back when using the shaver.  Also, there is no need for shaving cream when dry shaving as you can see from the video the shaver doesn't take much effort to actually get the job done either.  I have recommended this shaver to many friends and family and no one has every had a negative thing to say about it.  Also, the handle is very lightweight and has an ergonomic curve to it that allows the user to reach the "hard to reach" areas.  Another feature of this shaver that is a huge benefit is the fact that it actually tackles longer hairs too so if you are shaving your back for the first time there's no need to use a hair trimmer or electric trimmer to trim away first.  The blade surprisingly works under any circumstance. Take a look at my video and please vote "yes" if you feel this video was helpful to you.

I thought I'd try this on a recommendation from a friend and have been absolutely astonished. I've used it twice a day on my face and back for the last month and even from after a couple of days use my skin immediately started clearing up and just kept getting better.

I absolutely love this product because it is as 100% pure as I have seen anywhere. It made the scratchy bits of my hands so soft on the first application. The dry winter air is killing me! What I really like about it the most is using it in my hair. I think it is important to know because of my hair type I am asian and my hair is long just past my waist. I am fanatical about having healthy hair even at the very bottom where as we all know is dead hair. Every time I wash my hair I apply the Argan Oil and I either blow dry it or let it air dry. Either way the oil absorbs beautifully into the cuticles of each strand. Having used this my hair is so much softer, silky and shinier!!

I have used this tool for several years now. I love this impact wrench. It is my favorite tool. It is not strong enough to brake truck lug nuts but I thats OK. That's not what this tool is for. I am a ford licenced mechanic and I use it every day for heavy mechanic work. Sometimes I have to brake the nuts and bolts with a breaker bar (like 5% of the time) but then I use this tool to take the nut or bolt out. Sometimes we mechanics encounter long bolts that would take 3 to 5+ minutes to take out with a regular ratchet. Imagine taking the transmission out from a ford explorer. It has 12 long bolts and like 18 medium bolts. Once they are all broken with the breaker bar is a matter of SECONDS to take those 12 bolts out. Normally I cut work time to a half or less using this tool. It has enough torque to help me with the 95% of the job. Deffinetely love this impact wrench. Mine is all dirty from mechanic work, looks like a Dalmatian (black grease spots) but it still going strong...

My son Loves it<br />I was looking for a stroller for my 2.5 year old boy, because he started making me crazy that he wants to move around his plush animals in a stroller like my 4 YR old daughter. I didn't believe that I would ever find a blue doll stroller, until I looked on Amazon.com and found this stroller. I loved it so much that I bought it in blue and pink.<br />Let me share some of the pros and cons of this product; the quality is decent for the price you pay-it is not going to last for years,but it will last for about 6  months to 1 year. But on the other hand it's not expensive, the fabric is really strong and nice,  and the swiveling wheels is a plus. Any time the stroller is in my way, I just fold it up and it packs small for easy storage. I also like that the seat belt is not a buckle - it is just 1 piece to slide the doll in & out.<br /><br />Over all this is a very decent stroller for this price.

I'm not much of a barbecue lover, but when I do want some barbecue taste, I want real taste and not some injected stuff. So, I decided to try these wood chips primarily because I love Mesquite flavored barbecue potato chips, and I wanted my chicken to have a good taste.  I must admit, these chips really pack some smoke power.  It really doesn't take that many chips to give your meat some awesome smoke flavor and taste, and you will also love the color it gives your meat after you are done cooking.  It gives it that nice deep red smokey look that I really like to see when I eat barbecue chicken.  The meat had such a great taste to the point where I really didn't have to use all that much barbecue sauce!  I'm loving how long these chips last, and I'm buying some more now so I won't have to run out.  I really think you'll love these if you want your smoked meat to have a great taste.  My next experiment is salmon!

I enjoy using looms myself. I'm in my 30s and I truly have a good time creating looms accessories.  Of course I go for more advanced and complicated design.  I fill orders for some organizations and make a little money on the side. But i really just enjoy making accessories.<br /><br />Infinity looms is not a well advertised brand but it really should be out there on the tv and magazines.  I find the quality of the bands to be really good. The bands have bright colors, and you get a  lot of colors in the deluxe kit.  The bands are soft, odorless, the have a good stretch which makes it easier for me to do complex designs.  The hooks are alright.  I do prefer s-clips over c-clips.  The loom itself is really good.  It's sturdy and not flimsy.  You can extend the looms to any length just keep attaching more looms.<br /><br />As far as i'm concerned with the many brands I've tried for looms, Inifity loom bands are on top.  Please try it out yourself and I'm sure you will also notice the difference.

I would recommend this book to parents, teachers and especially Autistic kids, no matter where they are on the spectrum. Luke not only provides invaluable insight into how AS affects his life, but how Autism affects the lives of his two younger brothers.

Luke breaks down a lot of stereotypes prevalent in pop culture today.<br /><br />He is witty, optimistic and has a great deal insightful in to human social behavior. His sense of humor is charming and very relatable.

I really love my tea. It's a source of great joy to me. I start and end my day with a glass of tea more often than not. The yogi java herbal tea is one of my favorites. It tastes good and I know it's good for me which just makes it that much better. The flavor is great and the feelings of relief are wonderful after a long, hard day of work.<br /><br />My greatest feeling comes when I add 5-htp and melatonin ([[ASIN:B00CBE7IDU Melatonin 5 mg - 180 Capsules + FREE 5-HTP 100 mg - 60 Capsules]]) to the tea though; talk about an overwhelming calm! All the stress from my day is immediately wiped away when I use this blend! The flavor of the yogi and power mixed with those supplements gives me the ultimate rush of content. I feel so balanced when I have a glass of tea using those that it's almost intoxicating. The feelings are so hard to put into words.<br /><br />A bag of the tea is the perfect amount of flavor for my glass, with a little of each powder it's like a calm bliss. None of the day's baggage seems relevant anymore. I love that feeling. My mood is instantly improved and I am able to sleep soundly knowing I have the stress off my shoulders for the time being. It's a great way to enhance your overall well being. I suggest the blend to any natural tea lover like me!

I started eating Manuka honey a couple of years ago when I was on a trip over to New Zealand. There were a lot of cool little honey shops spread throughout the country so I ended up tasting a lot of different regional honeys. Happy Valley was one of the honey shops that we stopped into. Most of the honeys we tried down there tasted pretty amazing and were full of health benefits.  We bought some of this and the Wildflower blend recently and they are just like the honeys I had when I was traveling over there.  It is really cool to see that I can get this without having to go all the way down to New Zealand. This is  beautiful mild honey and I put it anything, so not overpowering - a real clean taste.

&#34;Vine Customer Review of Free Product (What's this?)<br /><br />My friend has one of these:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B003LSTD38<br /><br />We all have external portable hard drives. Most of us have several of them. Like rabbits, they seem to multiply over time. And they get larger--much larger. What was 250 GB the day before yesterday was 500 GB yesterday and a terabyte today. The more they hold, the more we stand to lose if they are dropped and the data is not backed up elsewhere.<br /><br />Sadly, the portable drives that carry around our prized possessions (photos, music, videos, data files, etc.) often go unprotected. (True, some portable hard drives come with cases of sorts--but, really, how good is their protection?) And consider how many portable drives we purchase that come with no case at all. Nothing to protect that which is protecting our valuable data. How can this be allowed?<br /><br />Apparently, the folks at Amazon have recognized this shortcoming and have offered us a solution in the AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Case for My Passport Essential. The case feels rugged enough and while it doesn't offer a great deal of padding, the webbing and elastic drive strap inside may help in the event of a few minors falls. The case has a stiff outer shell that may provide some additional protection. Most importantly, you have something to keep your portable drive housed in while it is not in use.<br /><br />Although they do vary a bit in size and shape, most modern portable drives seem close to being the same form factor. That led me to wonder why Amazon singled out the Passport Essential Drive for this case. Was it some cross advertising deal with Western Digital? Was it that they plan to offer an entire line of AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Cases each intended for a specific manufacture's model? So, in the interest of science, I conducted an experiment to see what other portable drives might fit in this case. I gathered my portable drives togetherand tried each one individually in the carrying case that I had received. Here are my results:<br /><br />* Maxtor 320 GB (very old drive) - Too large to fit<br />* OWC Mercury 250 GB - Too large to fit (besides it comes with its own leather case)<br />* Seagate Expansion 500 GB- Too long to fit<br />* Seagate FreeAgent Go 640 GB - Too large to fit (besides it comes with its own case)<br />* WD Elements Portable SE 320 GB - It fits, but it is a very tight squeeze<br />* Toshiba 640 GB - Fits perfectly<br />* WD My Passport 500 GB - Fits and actually is a bit small for the case<br />* WD My Passort Essential 1 TB - Fits perfectly (as was expected)<br />* WD My Passport Studio 500 GB - Too large to fit<br />* Apple iPhone 3GS - Fits perfectly (it's not a hard drive, but I just had to give the iPhone a try)<br /><br />(* No drives were intentionally harmed during this testing.)&#34;

My Mac started to lose its letters on its keys and I got them changed by apple, saw this and thought I would give it a try, if you are thinking about protecting your keyboard this s a must. The silicone us so thin it just stays in place over your keyboard, it doesn't slip or move around and there is no strain on the hinge when you close the laptop. I was so impressed I bought a second cover and three of my friends also purchased when they saw it too.

I am a passionate motocyclist for many years. And in this time I tried a lot of balaclavas. But most of them were just of a bad quality. Either the fabrics was tearing apart, or it was worn out after a few uses or it was just itchy to my scalp.<br /><br />But not with these balaclavas. It feels very good on my skin (absolutely no itching) and it also saves of from the wind that goes under my helmet. It fits on my big head (helmet size XXL) and also on my wifes head that is much smaller than mine (S)<br />Alltogether these balaclavas are in a high quality that all the motocycle gear should be.

My husband and I use Quickbooks for our small business and I'm fairly good at it. By that I mean that I can enter what I'm supposed to enter where I'm supposed to enter it so that at the end of the year our accountant can make sense of it all, but I've never really understood accounting. I was taught how to use the program and I just do it.<br /><br />However, now that I've got this book I'm beginning to understand just what it is that I've been doing. This book starts off simple than moves you into the more difficult aspects of accounting. It's written so anybody can understand it and it's not boring at all. If you want to get started in accounting, this book for dummies (hey, I'm no dummy) will really help you.

These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B008BXB76Y DRE Phones http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00E9262IE  But they are the best I've heard in the sub $100 price range. Possibly comparable to these Sennheisers Earbuds http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B001EZYMF4  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00T56GFTA  Pros + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode and not stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00T56GFTA  I hope this review was helpful!

I have been a long time customer of Todd's Seeds and these organic alfalfa seeds are right up there with the organic broccoli seeds they sell. First, it's amazing how many seeds come in the one pound bag. Second, it's really amazing how many sprouts you can get out of just a few tablespoons of seed!<br /><br />Most people do not realize that because they are so small, the alfalfa sprouts contain a concentrated amount of certain vitamins and minerals such as calcium, vitamin K and vitamin C. Alfalfa sprouts contain just 8 calories and 0 grams of fat per cup. We eat these alone, and on our sandwiches. We like the Todd's Seeds brand because he sent us a copy of the laboratory testing they do to verify no pathogens, ecoli, etc. You need good seeds to get good sprouts!

In the past few years, I don't know what happened to my dog. He used to be such a friendly little pup, always listening to me and everyone, but suddenly everything changed and he became a devil. He started howling and barking all night long for absolutely no reason at all. He bit my daughter when she tried to play with him, and it doesn't stop here. Whenever he gets a chance he bites, nips and jumps at people. We have given him a room in our house, but he totally ruined it with filth.<br /><br />Me and my wife were looking for some dog training device to control our dog as he was getting aggressive day by day. He runs into the kitchen and into everything he sees. He was out of control so much that I would have killed him or gave him to someone else if I wouldn't have got my hands on this dog training shock collar with vibration. It worked perfectly as I had to use different levels of shock for my dog. I never used a dog collar before, but it certainly is a valuable product for dog owners.<br /><br />After using the collar on my dog, I am shocked and happy to see him back in his decent and obedient self again. I recommend this device to all the dog owners out there.

it did work great for my hp Pavilion dv5-1160us.this battery is a longer life model and is larger than the standard model. It creates a &#34;bump&#34; along the back on the bottom of the laptop but I like it because it raises the back about 1/2 inch and I think this helps with cooling since air can get underneath the machine. Plus the laptop is slightly slanting towards you just like many desktop keyboards that have the little flip down tabs to raise the back of the keyboard a little bit. It's a bit heavier than the OEM but I don't find that to be any problem.

It is beginning to be summer time, and we all know what that means! Flies and mosquitos. They are very annoying all summer long especially while you are trying to enjoy the outside. The flies are already out this year and I needed something to get rid of them. I was offered this at a promotional rate and I jumped at the chance because my last fly swatter broke last year. The problem I have a lot of the time in getting fly swatters is that they are too flimsy and make it where you cant benefit from it. These were very strong and killed flies very easily. I think these will be long lasting.

My hats off to the folks at Vilso for  not only putting out a quality product but also going the distance to be one of the first to offer sound support as well as loaded with all the things needed to make it the best box on the market bar none I have ever used. The box boots up lightening fast and everything flows smoothly as it should. Having the extra GB of memory makes a huge difference. xbmc works better on this box than any of the others I have used. The repos installed have everything one could wish for. I've used this for nearly a month now of hard use and have yet to have the first issue with it. The only thing I could wish for is a better design in the factory remotes but now its coming together with an additional air mouse remote control that makes it much better I'm a happy camper.

If you're in the HR department of such a company it should probably be required reading. This book explains the value of employees to a company and thus the HR department.

This is an excellent kettlebell with excellent price, it totaled less than most good quality kettlebells run before shipping is even added-on. It has a shiny black coat and is very smooth. The handle is larger in comparison to the other kettlebells I own--I have 2 GoFit and 1 Body Solid. It is both larger around the circumference of the handle itself, AND there is a larger space in the area between the handle and top of the bell. This works out well for me, I can get a better grip with a single hand because of the thicker width.

This mount is a beast and that's just what I needed for my huge display. I have a 90 some pound 70 inch and this mount holds it like its nothing. Now the mount is heavy and big itself so I guess that can be a draw back, but it has to be if your trying to get it to hold screens of this size and weight. It was pretty easy to install with a friend I would not recommend doing it alone it is a two man job. Once the we had it up and got my heavy tv on it everything held and didn't budge. When it came to moving it one of the joints were a little stiff just enough to bug me, I was able to adjust the swivel tension screw and fixed it with ease. This mount moves with ease as I change up the direction my display is facing all depends on where I am sitting or at in my room. But I can see the screen from a prefect angle wherever I wanted to be. I really have nothing bad to say about this mount just something's I pointed out. like I said you will need someone to help you because its heavy but other than that its smooth sailing. make sure your screwed into your studs! Great mount able to handle a large tv set with no problem.

This stainless steel product  is high quality and easy to clean.  The silicon handle and lid are well constructed and securely attach to the infuser. The product comes with a drip tray that could also be used to cover a tea-cup for warmth.<br /><br />It was a joy to use this product this past week.

The text itself really highlights the divinity of our Messiah and the overarching story of the Remnant of Israel which must return to the land. Every time I read this book I glean something new! Plus, the cover has a wonderful velvety feel to it, super important if you are a lover of books :)

Good book. Interesting stories of the experiences of PayPal founder Peter Thiel. Interesting discussion about what it takes to make really innovative, prosperous companies with what Thiel describes as monopolies. His definition of monopoly is a company that creates something really new and innovative, not a company that has secured legal protection of some sort. Thiel says to create a blowout start up, one must create something really new, not just copy someone else's success. The next Zuckerberg will not create a social networking site. The next Gates will not create an operating system. They will create a new product that will launch a whole new category of product and they will continue to innovate and be productive for years and hold onto their monopoly status by bringing something new to the table, not just rehashing old ideas or products

I just got these a few days ago and have not stopped using them, really impressed with the overall product. The features are really excellent, you can walk around the house doing laundry, vacuuming and cleaning while enjoying music (I usually stream Pandora or my Apple radio app) and the sound quality is loud and very nice. What I love most about this is when someone calls you, you can hear your phone ringing without knowing where your phone is to answer the call - just press the button on the side and boom you're talking to whoever called you. That's surely amazing and I haven't seen a feature like this. The other party just does not know I am on a headset and they are impressed every time I tell them. The range is also very good I can go around 30 feet and no loss of signal and quality. The headphone looks great, I love the black and red design, the buttons feel great and the pads are soooo soft wow. I can definitely say without thinking twice that this is an excellent little headset with some cool technology.

I don't throw around words like brilliant very often, but this debut novel is it. I kept asking myself...how does he do it? This gentleman bravely chose to write in the first person a woman's life from childhood to older age. She experiences everything from an alcoholic mother, to a husband with early onset Alzheimer's disease. This was amazing in its depth and insight. Nothing about this book was easy material, and he wrote it with such delicacy. Sad topics like Alzheimer's can come off overwrought, but not here; he dealt with it with dignity and humanity. The most impressive thing was his ability to be so immersed in the female mind as the main character. I feel like authors spend entire careers trying to do what he accomplished in his first novel. I hope he keeps writing, because I will be a reader of his for many years to come

&#34;You really have to spend a lot more coin to get better performance than what this uniquely delivers and the percentage better is extremely minimal for the large jump in price.

I mean look for yourself, check the reviews, price shop, comparison shop, but you’ll probably agree with me in the end.<br /><br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00U5INHSE<br /><br />This is not perfect, but for me it is about as close as it gets. I am a big fan and it suits my needs well.<br /><br />PROS<br />Build Quality, is really well done. Everything seems sturdy and good. My friends have commented on it's high build quality<br />It's a really good size<br />Price. One really can't complain for something this price and such good build quality.<br />Appearance. Now, this probably isn't attractive to everyone, but to most people it will be a hit.

I had tried so many things and nothing had worked, my wee cat was looking awful and beginning to be in pain from his many matts.<br />We had to hold him down the first time using this due to his previous (wasted) experiences of attempted matt removal. Right from the start I couldn't believe how much matted fur this removed, easily and painlessly! It took several sessions over a period of a week or two, due to the severity of the matts, but my cat is now back to normal and I am so grateful, if this hadn't worked I was at the stage of resorting to having my vet shave him! I can't recommend this product highly enough. Don't waste time and stress trying anything else this is a miracle product

These are by far the best headset I have ever owned. I must admit they are the first closed ear headphones. I've tried beyerdynamic, beats and sennheiser and they are equally good, but like the beyer i just find ridiculously expensive and yet sounds thesame as the m50. You can hear everything, midrange and bass is just fantastic. I spent quite a fortune on these but having tried those that were half a grand I feel like I snatched this one right out of the store.

Wow! Personally, I think this is one book that will be enjoyed by everyone no matter your age is. If you are an animal lover, it will be a perfect read for you. I love all the characters here especially Boris, Olga, Charlie and Gus. They are all very different from one another but that's what made this story more interesting. It has a lot of moral lessons to tell so, I think it'll be a really great read for kids. It shows how wonderful love is between humans and animals. Also, it gives the feeling of hope. No matter how tragic your life had become, it'll be change one day just like what happened to Boris and Olga. They both had a terrifying past but sooner or later, they found a loving family that gives them all the love and caring that they need and they are also able to experience lots of exciting adventures that they really enjoy. After reading this book, I feel more inspired to love animals more. It made me want to have a real life Boris, Olga, Charlie and Gus to take care of. It really is a great book. I highly recommend it.

High quality keyboard, Easy set up, Great Value, works well !<br />Perfect fit for the Galaxy tab pro 8.4 tablet! I can't stress enough how great the customer service has been between the seller and Amazon. You guys rock! The case itself is extremely well made. The front cover is thin (in a GOOD way) and the back portion fits the Galaxy tab pro 8.4 tablet like a glove! The magnets used are strong and hold very well. The front and back are a sort of leathery material while the undersides of the front and back are a soft touch material (sort of a soft felt). The two viewing angles available are perfect for using in your lap or on a desk. The magnet on the back of the case to keep the front cover folded back was a nice touch as well. I don‘t often write reviews but this one is well deserved,  Thanks Gambolex and thanks Amazon! 5 stars for sure!

The perfect sports utility bag at such an affordable price. Its really hard to believe that such a quality bag priced so affordable. I needed a multi-purpose bag my badminton and crickets class. With this bag, I am able to put my rackets and cricket bat in the same bag, without having to worry about space. Other than that, the leather is absolutely fantastic and suits the rough purpose I meant to buy it for.

Great item. I use it to protect an ipad mini from a 6yr old. Very durable, excellent drop protection, very useful "handle" that folds back to provide tilt when used on a lap or desk, also props up like a mini lcd for watching movies etc. My only concern is the handle may pull apart from the case, as it is apparently secured with two very small steel pins. So far this has not been an issue, the case has been in use for several months and is holding up well.<br /><br />I recommend this case for anyone considering an ipad mini for child. I would definitely buy it again.

This hat is great for outdoors running/jogging.  It has reflective stripes so those in cars can see you at night.  It is also great to wear in the day to keep the sun out of your eyes.  It fit my head very well.  I love the mesh because your head can actually breathe.  You get sweaty enough as it is when running or jogging or playing outside.  You don't need your hat adding to that.  This one is great and it has a great message.  Do life!  You never know what will happen tomorrow so enjoy it while it is here.  Cancer is a horrible disease and I'm happy to support awareness.

Puerto Rico is the best all around board game i have ever played. The balance i would say is near perfection and of all the games I've played the score was always very close.<br /><br />While this game out of the box takes a little while to understand the nuances of the rules and how to take advantage of the different roles, it's very worthwhile and rewarding. After two plays, my friends were all very into it and anxious to play again.<br /><br />The fifty foot view of the game looks something like this. Everyone has a board that has an area for placing plantations and city area for buildings. Plantations grow crops, you need certain buildings to produce/store the crops which go in the city area and you eventually want to ship those crops(back to the mainland...whateva) and that's how you ultimately score points. There are variety of different crops you can grow and different types of buildings which give different type of advantages(and are worth a certain # of victory points). Each person takes a turn and on their turn chooses a certain role which is how the game functions. Each role offers different functions/phases of the game, ie building where everyone gets to build a building, or captain where you get to ship your goods....the player choosing the phase typically gets and additional bonus which is where a lot of the strategy revolves around.<br /><br />Some of the things i like about Puerto Rico, are that you really don't know who's going to win until the game ends and the points are counted up. This keeps everyone interested and playing intently throughout. You also have to be alert on each turn and take advantage of other players moves in order be successful. Also, as the other reviewers have stated, luck simply is just not a factor so it's hard for people to be sore losers or point to game flaws that caused them to lose(or someone else to win), instead it's typically a friendly chat about how picking x and y strategy seemed to make the most sense.<br /><br/>The only real downside to this game, is that there really isn't the need for much interaction with other players, or any direct conflict. Those coming from a Settlers of Catan background, the robber phase and the trading are really what makes that...these features are lacking in Puerto Rico. Some say the captain phase can be like the 'conflict', but i disagree. This is a small quibble, and allows you to play with friends and non-friends with no-one getting upset.<br /><br />Many say that this game is too deep for non-gamers and that you may want to start off with simpler games to get up to speed. I would actually disagree with that. I've bought a lot of games in the past few months, and i think we could have played Puerto Rico right off the bat. If you are in the market for new board game, go with this game! Take a quick read through the rules, set it up and take a few rounds to get the questions out of the way...than start over and you'll be all set to enjoy a great game.

I love to use bike every day and I have purchased many bike lights in my life. Almost all were somehow difficult to use. The quality, too dim or the battery died quickly, something.<br /><br />I was in a need to purchase a new light and not long ago I came across this one. When I receive the light, I found it to be surprisingly bright, brighter than any flash light or bike light I brought in the past. I am really delighted about the high quality machining as well. The head and the tail turns very smoothly just like my Nikon camera lens.<br /><br />I sometimes feel that the High mode is too bright and when I want to save battery life I just its medium mode that is bright enough.  I found even the low mode is as bright as the other bike lights I had. I like the "half press” feature of the tail button that changes the mode much easier than other bike lights.<br /><br /> I sometimes commute to and from work in the dark and this light has kept me safe. Great value for the cost.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, this waterproof, astonishing bright LED light is not difficult to use. It is recommended by me to all bike lovers!

I was hoping to eliminate bacteria growing in the grooves as in the boards I currently have. I have used these for a few days now and love it for a variety of reasons.<br />1. No deep cuts yet- these are made of a soft material but so far my sharp knives haven't made any marks. That means no bacteria in deep grooves, and no plastic finding its way into my food.<br />2. Dishwasher safe! Easy to throw in for a good cleaning, and they are flexible so they can squeeze in where a firm cutting board would not fit.<br />3. Sterilize in the microwave if you are worried about bacteria. 60 seconds will kill over 99% of bacteria, or so it claims. It can fold up with a built in latch to fit right in the microwave. Not hot when you pull it out either.<br />4. These are color coded with a picture to easily avoid cross contamination. Meat, veggies, fish.<br />5. Lightweight- my baby was once hit in the head when a cutting board fell out of my cupboard right above her. If this cutting board hit her in the head, she'd probably laugh. Very lightweight.<br />6. Love the flexibility! Because these are so flexible, you can cut up your veggies or chicken or whatever, and then fold and dump over your pot. Huge timesaver to avoid many trips with full hands, and then spills of whatever missed your pot.<br />7. Takes up less room in my cupboard! Super thin!

Becoming Jinn is a beautifully crafted, carefully written tale of 16-year-old Azra who has what we all think we want -- the power to grant wishes (and I say this as a completely biased husband of the author but I assure you, every word is true). Azra is a smart, funny, caustic, bedeviling, and one-of-a-kind character rarely seen in YA.<br /><br />When the silver bangle is clasped around her wrist that provides this power, it's the final straw in a lifetime fighting the inevitable servitude that this precious gift will truly entail. Azra descends from a long line of Jinn -- what we refer to as genies -- and a strong incident in her past has turned her away from magic, her Jinn heritage, and her Zar sisters. Finally unable to escape, Azra is faced with the dilemma of becoming Jinn in a world of humans who she must hide her powers from and yet live among, including the terrific and self-depreciating Henry across the street and her lifeguard crush Nate. Azra must navigate the increasingly complicated world she now inhabits, learning magic, hiding her true self from her friends, and avoiding the Afrit, who rule over the Jinn and keep the wish-granting Jinn and their mothers separated from the males. As Azra's first-person tale unfurls, the author is able to demonstrate the frustration, fear, and confusion we all faced as teenagers and journeyed toward adulthood, jockeying for position, affections, and our rightful place, all with Azra's wry sense of humor and wit, which punctuates the book throughout. The book builds momentum to an unstoppable pace, beginning with Azra's birthday, through her wish-granting, and ultimately to the incidents that bring her full circle in her journey of accepting being Jinn. Barreling to the end, you will finish demanding that book 2 be released much sooner than April 2016!<br /><br />This is a triumphant debut by an author with a particular talent for creating believable and relatable characters, accurate dialog, and terrific turns of phrase. Even if the author wasn't my wife, I would recommend the book to anyone who loves good characters, humor, and a well-executed tale.

The wire spring, which brings them back to the open position, is strong enough to do that job but is not so strong that she has problems closing the tongs around things she is trying to get a hold on. The wider silicone ends of the tongs allow you to grasp what ever it is you are trying to grasp and there is much less dropping of food. The silicone padded handles make them extremely comfortable to use. Also, the handles are wide and hefty enough to enable the user to get a good grip and keep it. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a quality silicone tongs at a reasonable price. The silicone feels great in your hand and they are easy to use. The color is a nice red.

This is not a very attractive looking light, but it is quite bright and the long neck turned out to be super helpful as we mounted this light above the barn door under the eave. The long neck allows the light to be in the full sun just about all day.<br /><br />This light comes without any instructions. The only thing you need to know is that the light should be turned on once by pushing a switch in a small hole on the light side (see video). I used a sewing needle to do it, but a paper clip or any other thin thing will work. The light is quite bright. I am attaching several shots of the light over the door of our barn during the day and during the night, you can see that it lights a fairly large area pretty well.<br /><br />One of the immediately noticeable things about this particular solar light was the fact that it would extend out away from a building rather than stay flush against it. This is perfect if you want to light up a walkway or need to push light slightly away from a building. I have a couple of solar lights that are motion-sensing, but so not emit a bright steady light like this one does.<br /><br />There are twelve LED lights beneath the solar panel that even give off some light during the day in a dimmed room. The pole is a generous 15-1/2&#34; long, 1/4&#34; thick, and quite sturdy. On the side with the LED lights it can be activated by pressing a pen into a small hole marked on/off. It's actually quite easy to overlook this and that I did. I had the panel charging, but because I had it facing up I didn't notice.<br /><br />The lighting is excellent and very bright. I do have another LEAGY solar light and the brilliant LED lights are ultra-bright as stated. All of the hardware is included in the package. I very much like the fact that the lighting has the ability to catch the solar rays more readily than those lights that hug the side of a building, a big plus during the winter months.<br /><br />FEATURES:<br /><br />1.

This 6 pint compartment condiment holder truly simplifies family get together's and other functions.  It also cuts down on the amount of space needed for all the different things such relishes, condiments, onions and other necessities to a good cook out.  I love that this condiment tray has a built in cover that is easily slid back down.  There is also a compartment in the bottom of this that will allow you to put ice.  Clean up is very easy with this due to each compartment being removable.

The book is very informative, up-to-date and easy to follow and will certainly aid you in the creation of your trust. The creation of a trust is essential to ensure the costly approach of probate can be avoided. Having a previous experience where my fathers estate was virtually wiped out due to probate, I cannot stress how important a trust is. His estate was valued just over $105k, I received around $17k after probate. Probate costs work off the gross value of the estate not the net. I will ensure this dreadful experience is not passed on to my family.<br /><br />The forms themselves are easy to follow with a good set of instructions. They can be downloaded or are available on the CD-Rom which accompanies the book. Each trust has a binding arbitration clause to ensure where beneficiaries contest your decisions, they effectively agree to receive almost nothing. Having visited an attorney, this was highly recommended so it was a relief to see this contained in the forms

We ordered this for our daughter's office/guest room. During the day it is a very comfortable couch and at night it easily turns into a comfortable bed. It is really comfortable - better than any other futons or pull out beds that I have tried. The color is true to the picture, it folds out easier than any other futon I have used and as far as assembly - it was no worse than any other product you have to assemble. We are very pleased and I relied heavily on the reviews of other customers when I ordered this product.

Brighter than the average lantern I recently got. Why didn't I buy this lantern in the first place. Well, I bought a lantern before, but I'm not that satisfied, it has a poor quality performance. I charged the lantern for 2 hours and it drains really faster, well maybe I got the defective one, but I didn't bother returning back since I only got it in a cheaper price. Now, I bought this a couple of weeks ago and it's really bright as all of the reviews said. I am totally happy and satisfied with this Led lantern.

My Doberman Pinscher Hurley is a great guard dog, but ever since he was a puppy he would bark at anything that moved! I was a little nervous to put a shock collar on him, but the Petiner Advanced No Bark Dog Training Electric Shock Control Collar is nothing like that. After researching the product, I learned that the electric shock is more like a slight tickle which must feel like the light static-like surprise of touching a metal doorknob. After receiving the control collar and putting it on Hurley, I couldn't believe how well he responded to it! He enjoys wearing it more than his usual collar! And it worked like a charm, he stopped barking and it seemed like the impulse to bark just subsided.<br /><br />There's many products that market themselves in the training of stopping barking, but none have worked as well or have been as highly recommended as this one. It's a best buy for all pet owners!

Definitely a quality product! I love the design and efficiency of the product (easy to use, clean and store). It holds both my small and large cookbooks very well (you can adjust it to your liking).

It is especially handy when I am using a recipe off my iPad (I don't have to worry about damaging the screen).<br /><br />Shipping was quick! I was surprised how fast it arrived! Very well packaged- the product was in perfect condition! So happy with this good looking cookbook holder!! I highly recommend it.

Works very well making holes for leather belts. If unsure of hole size, I would start with one that fits in the current hole. If still too small, then go to the next larger one and so on until you get the same hole size. You wouldn't want to start too large or the new hole will not look the same as the others. :) Cuts right through the leather with a quick snap, but does indent on the other side. Simply flip the belt over align a very visible indent and finish the cut. VERY clean hole.

"Of Martyrs and Marigolds" lays out the history of the Bengali nation rising out of the ashes of East Pakistan. The story sent chills down my spine. The Pakistan army's horrific massacre of the Bengalis  and the killing of Urdu-speaking people by the Bengalis need to be looked at together. While the atrocities by the Pakistan army has been told and re-told this is the first well written account of both sides of the story. No one wins when innocent blood is shed. The novel is one that should be read by all those who abhor war and violent political conflict.

Before stumbling upon the Bad Ash 2 (love the name btw) I actually ruined my expensive home vacuum. Even though the debris I was picking up was cold, the vacuum repair guy mentioned that the fine particles just weren't designed to be picked up by a household item and generally clogged up the motor. That's when he suggested I try I vacuum specifically designed for ash and debris pickup. After some research I came across the Bad Ash 2. I tried it and it did an excellent job. If you have a fireplace or are looking for a faster alternative to scooping up your ash with a broom and dust pan, I would highly recommend the Bad Ash 2.

On a recent trip to various Caribbean islands, I used a Buddy Book Bag travel money belt.  I have used other money belts, but this one was by far the most comfortable.  The clip stayed fastened so I did not have to worry about it being secure.  The belt's 2 different zippered pockets, allowed me to keep my cash separate from my passport and credit cards.  One of the pockets even had additional dividers that helped me stay organized.  The zippers are strong and the belt is very durable.  This is the best money belt I have ever used.  High quality, comfortable and a great value.  Strongly recommend.

I must say, I never made holes in granite so quickly! After 5 holes, the bit still looks ok. Could do a few more but I am done anyways. It goes without saying, I used a water bath around the hole to keep the drill bit wet and cool. A ring of plumber's putty does the trick.

I was pressed to read this book. Ha! I wasn't expecting to like it but I ended up loving it. It's very clever. I like that children's/readers' actions “write the book" and that it's an enjoyable activity, and that it helps young kids with fine motor skills, and counting skills and with learning colors, and directions (left, right, up, down). As readers follow the directions, it will seem to them that they are creating what's on the next page. What a great idea!<br />This is a very entertaining, interactive book, and at the end kids are invited to read again, and will likely want to read (play) again.

It took a day or two to get used to but now I feel weird sitting in my office chair without it. It's comfortable, holds air great, and you can move around on it without feeling like you are on a seesaw. It's helped my posture as well. I haven't had to reinflate it at all, and I've been using it for a couple of months now. 3 others in my office purchased one and have the same positive feedback. They also don't look as wacky and cumbersome as the exercise ball chairs, and deliver the same results of good posture/abs while sitting at your desk. I also bought one for my mother who had hip replacement surgery and she said it has really relieved pressure when she needs to sit at her computer for awhile. I haven't used it for an exercise tool, but it feels sturdy enough when I stand on it to do a great job for that as well.

Our home sits on a hill and the driveway is approximately 180 feet long. Sometimes no one in the home can hear if someone is coming up the driveway, especially when it comes to delivery personnel. Even with four dogs that have full access of our property - the dogs just kept on sleeping on our bed. This drives me nuts because delivery people would leave packages any place they wanted to (we have 5 entry doors to our home) and I felt like I was playing a scavenger game hunt...find the package.<br /><br />My husband decided to construct a large wooden package drop off box half way down our driveway. It is very nicely built with the word &#34;packages&#34; in big black bold letters on it. However, there was still no way of knowing when packages were dropped in it. In comes the Sado Tech Wireless PIR  Motion Sensor!<br /><br />Upon receipt I read the instructions and followed how to pair my Transmitter and Remote to the Receiver. It was super easy and I didn't even need to read the instructions that were included, Waved my hand across the Transmitter and it came to life. It has 50 different tones to choose from.

It's really light, and weighs less than a pound which I like. My DSLR is already heavy enough and I don't need another heavy monitor in my backpack. It plays in full 1080p, and the aluminum cover design protects the screen while I transport it from location to location.<br /><br />As you could probably tell, I use this monitor as a second screen for my DSLR. I have the Canon 5D2, and I've always wanted to buy one of those DSLR monitors to look at a bigger screen when filming. But of course, DSLR monitors are pretty expensive- and this is where I found GeChic 1303H. So far I'm loving it- there aren't any other portable monitors out there that have HDMI and VGA. This is probably the only brand out there. It's reasonably priced- other DSLR monitors are more than 500+.<br /><br />I took it out for filming yesterday and everything was great- I had to use a battery pack to power the monitor. The USB power cable is dual USB- so I had to use two battery packs to power the monitor. Actually one is enough, but sometimes the power supply isn't enough so it is better to use two.<br /><br />Note to other DSLR users out there: I had to use an additional adapter to connect the monitor to my camera. Mini HDMI to HDMI adapter. But I had one already so that wasn't a problem. Just a heads up for the others out there!

This collar saved my dog. After tons of research, watching videos, reading reviews, and checking consumer sites I decided to buy Oternal electric no bark collar.This collar is such a miracle worker.

I still put the collar on her when I leave the dorm apartment just in case but it really is just a training tool.this collar is just amazing. It's worth the money investment. I barely use it and the battery is still full after 3 weeks. I would recommend this collar for anyone who wants to keep their dog. This is the miracle collar and works great even on small dogs like my pnut she is a pomchi  weighs about 8 lbs. The collar isn't too heavy for her. She is able to eat, drink, jump on her bed, and function with it on when I'm not home. I do know that my neighbors haven't complained since I have gotten this and they actually like her now and say Hi to me in the hallways instead of giving me dirty looks before I got this collar.

Great book, I have the hard copy and kindle version. It was an absolutely informative read as I have been interested in immersing myself into more EB-5 information. It honestly has given me a more high-level, high-ground perspective on the entire industry (especially the investors and developers). I love the step-by-step guide in both the distinctly separated investors and developers section. I thought that was very helpful in separating the roles of the two bigger players in the industry.<br /><br />There is just too much information about EB-5 floating around, specifically biased articles from the media. This book was able to give me a clear-headed idea of exactly how I should approach the people within the industry and how to explain it to those who are interested in entering the industry. EB-5 is definitely a complex industry and it's not something that is easy to just dive into. I believe the book was a great starting point for myself.

Plus there is no dripping of the oil once the bottle is placed upright.  No more drops on stove or counters.  I am actually very pleased with this stainless pour spout!  Cook on!

A little practice goes a long way. Yeah, yeah, that's the saying. However, does it really hold any value? Yes, it does. When you practice with a purpose, you can be sure to get the results you want. It will be especially true in your case if you get this set of practice questions for the Praxis II Middle School: Content Knowledge exam. Practicing is so nice you get to do it twice. This aid includes two sets of complete practice questions for the exam.

&#34;Big Mike's Fitness&#34; have some marvelous fitness products and here is another one. Weight lifting is a common exercise in gym and 10-20 kg is common for us . But when it is 40-60 then it's sometimes risky and uncomfortable also. A good weight lifting belt can help you out for the comfortableness.<br />The main fact is this is so reliable and can be use for multiple used randomly. I think this will be a long lasting belt for me.

I saw the mandoline slicer for the first time when I watched my friend prepare a gourmet, vegan meal for her guests. She used to be a chef and mentioned this was one of the tools she used to do a more efficient and quicker prepping routine. It's something a lot of professionals use and there's some versions that have up to 5 features depending on what you're cutting, which makes the mandoline slicer pretty versatile. It leaves everything with a cleaner cut, and you can cut more at a faster rate. The hand guard was designed way for safer use (especially when you're going at your prepping routine really quickly) and for easier cleaning. Pretty good idea I think! I got this one plus the professional version.

Bought this for my daughters room. Not only is it practical & useful for task lighting, but also works as a decorative element in the room. The colors of shades are very vibrant. It's stunning on or off. This light also has 3 lighting options. You can have all the lights on when needed, or just three, or just two. The arms are bendable so that you can point the lighting in the direction needed. Have not had it long, so I can't attest to the longevity of it, but so far we give this a big thumbs up.

My daughter has been obsessed with collecting all of the Swarovski ornaments since I can remember and now that she's off on her own I wanted to get this year's for her tree. I haven't given it to her but I did open it up and make sure everything was looking good: I'll do my custom wrap before giving it to her soon. I've seen a lot of these ornaments in action in the past and they really shine and sparkle like you've never seen. In my opinion the price is kind of steep but I realize that there's a lot of workmanship that goes into each and every one. I know she'll love it!

This silicone cutting board is very thick and durable, yet its design is elegant and very premium looking board. This premium cutting board is not an easy thing to find when it comes to premium built with its modern design. Most of it on the same kind out there are pretty ugly, and easily get stained and hairline scratches when used with force. But not this one. This silicone cutting board is as durable as I thought. Marks aren't visible even until now after using it for several months and it is still on its brand new looking condition. I have recommended this to some of my colleagues and neighbors and they are very happy with its heavy duty materials that really help this board to stay usable for years!

I ordered this bath mat for my daughter's bathroom. It ensures that my daughter is safe from slipping and also, the design is stylish and trendy. It adds to the overall appeal of the bathroom and the pebble pattern looks actually like a 3D pattern. Also, the rubber present is of high quality and this door mat appears to be a luxurious product. What makes the bath mat wonderful is that the surface is smooth and soft, at the same time, it does not slip in any condition. I have finally found a solution for my otherwise slippery bathroom flooring! Also, the product is of premium quality and even after extensive usage, it shows no sign of wear off!

What a fantastic book on hitting by one of the greates all-time hitters, Ted Williams. In a nutshell, its a book designed to teach the reader to hit better by showing them a comprehensive look at the science behind hitting. A few things that seemed to stand out:<br /><br />-the style of writing is like he's standing there talking to you which makes for an easy read<br />-the batting advice is pretty thorough leaving no stone unturned<br />-the battting advice is based on science<br />-the pictures demonstrating the techniqes are OUTSTANDING and include all angles including some very good overhead shots<br />-the stories he tells of other baseball players are priceless!<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who wants to hit a ball better, I found it to be a very well-rounded book based on both science AND experience. Also recommend [[ASIN:1457527243 Bulletproof Your Shoulder]] if you have a shoulder problem that interferes with your playing.

You will get that through the pages of this study. It allows you to find the underlying cause of things when it comes to studying. For example, you will definitely reveal secrets, you will learn how to apply concepts strategically in a general sense, and you will round that all out in some reports.

Indeed we can live to our highest potentials and make our short lives here on Earth as meaningful as possible. Thank you so much for writing eye-opening book. It's great to be given a pep talk on life and be reminded how much potential every person possesses. The fact that you are alive today makes you special having fought your way into human existence before conception. Even when we seem weaker than the rest, we can still rise up above the challenge and live our lives to the fullest by taking advantage of our situation in life. It doesn't matter whether we seem successful or not. Real success come from knowing our real value as a human being, that infinity we contain within our souls. I highly recommend this everybody right now. Our generation needs more writers like Olaoluwa to remind us that we are not our stuff. We are not our looks. We are who we are because of our souls and all the wonders we possess inside.

Disclaimer: this review is based on an advanced preview of the book<br /><br />I have worked in a limited capacity with Javascript and jQuery in the past - and found this book useful for filling in the holes in my understanding of how Javascript in particular actually worked. There were lots of points through the book where I found things out that I probably should have known but had never quite understood.<br />I also liked the way the software engineering focus to writing code in a style suitable for large applications.<br />The overview of the client side data storage APIs is the area I probably learned the most (I had really only heard of these before - never used them) and will definitely use these in the future.<br />I also learned a lot I didn't know about the new Javascript APIs around files and web workers.<br />The web application developed through the book is relatively simplistic - it would have been nicer if it was slightly more complex - but probably it was sufficient for demonstrating the subjects of the book.<br />Overall I would recommend for intermediate and senior programmers - but anyone new to Javascript may want to buy a beginners book first.

My wife appreciates the fact that the lowest lumens setting provides plenty of light for my night-time reading, thereby minimizing the disruption to her sleep. The strap is comfortable and of good quality, easy to adjust. I like the way it switches between white and red light.

For those of you who know, the Peak by devicewear is a "Wedge" style case. It is name this way because you can use the wedge shape that it makes to put it in either a horizontal, landscape or any other way you want it. I like this style of case because you get the most sturdy stand and don't have to worry about the case. I also like this style because I like to type small notes and the typing mode makes that really easy. I also like the way the ipad looks like it's framed in by the case. The stitching really is done well and makes the case stand out. I recommend this case highly to everyone I talk to and think it is a really great case.

A book spawned with deep intellect and even deeper philosophical meaning comes Yuehai Xiao's Crossing the Seas: A Diary of My Thoughts is a book of sheer empowerment to humankind. This book is written in diary format, which for one I love. It made it so easy to read and to absorb. I feel absorbance is the purpose. When we absorb things we become forced to think about them. Thought is a power motivator in life. People in this world are no longer free thinkers. We watch exactly what is put in front of us, and we accept it as gospel.<br /><br />When you read this book you know acceptance is not option. Xiao's has obviously taken much time and put much thought into this book. We as people have to learn to upgrade our thought process. I for one am an academic. I can test with the best and score high. I have excellent memorization skills. But it goes no further than that. Yes I am memorizing but I have never learned to absorb it. I am 37 years old. And it's truly sad. When it comes to my life I am testing at a D level at best.<br /><br />If we continue on this path of learning and not absorbing we are a doomed species. I think this book it gets to the heart of it all. So our youth can grow, learn and absorb. It has always been about how much you can learn and how fast. It needs to be about what you learn and what you can absorb, and use to help humanity. I believe that this book is trying to help us a people open our minds wider so we can absorb more. It's definitely a book that will leave you with a lot to think about in the end.

At first I was a bit skeptical about buying a book from a new author but I<br /> must say this was well worth it. To be honest I think the price should be<br /> more for this book.

I've owned, used and abused, several tripods in my life, but this is clearly one of the best, though not the lightest. Yes, it's a bit heavy, but it won't fall down and with the shoes that come with it you can shoot on a sandy or slicky beach, even put the tripod on rocks, if you have to to get the shot, without worrying too much, though I'd worry anyway, can't help myself.<br /><br />This is also my first Vanguard tripod and after having used it for awhile now, I don't know why I haven't had one before, because it's apparent to me now that Vanguard is a company with photographers on their mind.

After hearing all the bad reviews about getting a Caniam brand and such I decided to really research into this.<br /><br />So I emailed many sellers of what their logos were on it. There was only two sellers who told me that they had the Canon logo (W&H Store) and (Pocket Store).<br /><br />I decided to go with W&H Store cause they were cheaper and boy did I make the right choice. Lens came extremely earlier than expected and it did indeed have the Canon logo and Made In Japan text. As a person who loves photography and almost anything to do with it, this mug was a great buy.<br /><br />First thing I tried when I got it was testing if it really kept water in, as told by other reviewers. It leaks water from the drinking spout when you hold it upside down, but of course, the spout is just a hole with a cover, and why would I be drinking coffee upside down? So that didn't really matter.<br /><br />So other than that, this mug was a great buy, looks realistic, holds a nice capacity of coffee, and looks really realistic. I trick a lot of people into thinking It's a real lens when they first see it, so I wouldn't be surprised if I accidentally tried to stick this on my camera from time to time.

These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B008BXB76Y DRE Phones http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00E9262IE  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00UN5Z1BK  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Pros + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode andnot stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00UN5Z1BK

I do daycare, and this has been a favorite since we received it. I'm usually very pleased with Vtech toys in general, but this one hits it out of the park. I have one child who sits independently, and is just learning hand eye coordination. All he has to do is graze it with a touch, and it lights up, and plays music. He loves it. Then I have a 21 mo. old and we are starting to work on colors and such. The toy has a switch, and it changes it to a learning toy, so when things are touched it says colors and what not. Plus the fact that it's a walker, which is perfect for the almost 12 mo. old. Don't even get me started on the &#34;peek a boo game&#34; they can play, that gets an eruption of giggles!

Just peel and strip, and use the tong to place, which makes it so much easier and much less time consuming!

6 screws, 4 o-rings, 1 Allen Wrench If you can't put this together in less than 10 minutes you probably can't ride a bike anyway. Only one thing easier: ease of use. I have a small basement apartment with stairs that lead up to the owner's apartment. As these stairs are never used, I placed the base legs of the stand on one of the wider bottom steps and leaned it against the wall. The top bar that leans against the wall has a soft rubber/plastic cushioning pad - so it makes no marks on the wall. Also with stand leaning out away from the wall and hooks straight out - my bike's handlebars never touch the wall. Unless you hang a motorcycle from the hooks - they're not going to slip down. Excellent design! Great value! You will not be disappointed.

The cover worked fine for both our cars. It even covered the wipers! Part of the cover goes inside the car to add to the cover's security. Magnets are on the edges to keep it in place on the windshield. The cover is lightweight; so, it's easy to use everyday if neccessary. We just had our first snowstorm for the year, and the cover held up just fine in the midst of gusting winds.  I also have the added bonus of not having to scrape off windowshield ice. I would highly recommend this cover to anyone living in a snowy environment.

This is a revolutionary product that is ready to go straight out the box.  It is easy to adjust and has hard magnets (instead of the flexible ones) that stay in place when the deflector is on ceiling vents.  It does a great job of directing air or heat into the actual room instead of letting the air blow off to the side.  I really like how this deflector is saving me on energy costs because now the house is able to cool down or heat up at lower temperatures. It's transparent; so it doesn't clash with your wall paint or furniture arrangements. I am going to buy some more as back ups.  It's really a great invention that helps save on energy.

The remote app really needs improvement. Some days i can see my cameras, while other days i cannot. After several factory resets, i was able to get it to work but is still not 100% reliable. I will only be using these cameras 1.5 months out of the year for my Christmas light show display.

This is a great guide for any person who really concerns about their health status. Everything is based on scientifically proven facts. The author uses his collected experiences to give us an excellent guide to show how to control the blood sugar level and keep well away from being a diabetic patient. Some facts are a little difficult to understand for ordinary flacks who are unaware of science. That is actually the major minus point about this book. Other than that, the book is simply awesome. For such people who need something pretty useful and effective and easy to understand, I recommend [[ASIN:B00CWYQA6K Kick the Sugar, Feel the Freedom]]. It is as good as this guide.

I'm still amazed at the quality of these cables for the price. And they include- for free- a right angle adaptor, good cable ties, a cleaning cloth and a mini flashlight. I tie the flashlights to the backs of TVs so I can find the slots. Go look what this set would cost at the big box, and you will be amazed too.

I simply love how different this french press is from the average. Its so classy. It looks beautiful on the table when making breakfast for guests and you want to have a buffet style breakfast. I also belive that since it has the stainless steel design it keeps the coffee hot alot longer. That is definitely a plus when you are lounging and talking at breakfast. This french press is dishwasher safe so that means cleaning it isnt a hassle. I would definitely recommend this french press to every coffee snob out there.

I wind up using this way more than I thought I would.  It glows blue at night which I don't really love but I run it for about 8-10 hours on a bottle-full of water maybe a foot away from my head and I wake up with my nasal passages clear and happy. I often wake up very dry otherwise.  I know - there are big humidifiers that do the same thing, I've had them.  This little guy is a pleaser.  Fires right up shooting mist immediately.

Looks great with the matching http://amzn.to/1GNev00<br /><br />I am so happy with this bed skirt it's perfect with the bedspread that I have. My one complaint is that I would've liked it to be a little longer, the color of the bed skirt is perfect, and it was easy to place on my box spring. The price of this bed skirt was fabulous, and it was delivered really fast. I'm really happy that I found this bed skirt here on Amazon.<br /><br />Is it a thick, hotel-quality, fancy material? Does it get the job done? Yes. It is exactly what it says it is and you get exactly what you pay for. The material is thin, but it is only 200 thread count. I expected that. I am surprised at the negative reviews. For less than $20, I felt it was worth the risk. It is a fine bed skirt.<br /><br />If you want something cheaper go with http://amzn.to/1DqmnVU

I LOVE THIS BOOK AS I WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED WHAT THE VARIOUS WORLD RELIGIONS THOUGHT OF ANGELS. THIS IS THE ONLY SUCH BOOK ON THE TOPIC THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN AS SUCH AND IT PRESENTS SOME VERY INTERESTING INFORMATION AS HOW IMPORTANT AND CRUCIAL THE ROLE OF ANGELS IS IN THE VARIOUS HOLY BOOKS OF THE MAJOR RELIGIONS. IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING TO KNOW THAT THEY PLAY SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE RELIGIONS AND ARE VERY SIMILAR IN THEIR APPEARANCE AS INVISIBLE SPIRITS AND LIGHT BEINGS AND THAT THEY ARE MENTIONED HUNDREDS OF TIMES IN THE BIBLE FOR INSTANCE AND IN EVERY MAJOR RELIGION THEY ARE VERY PROMINENT IN THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY.

''We moved to a new house with a longer driveway and the view of the street is barely visible through all the trees and shrubs.

It was here in a matter of days and I had it setup within minutes. I screwed the sensor to the base of a tree 10' from the street and have the alarm in the kitchen.

I REALLY like this set, I had NO slipping or breaking issues. My is over 2 years old, I use them almost daily & 1 just broke. I especially like the smallest one. It makes getting to the bottom of jars like mayo, peanut butter, etc really easy. I like the curved one for scoping & scraping cake batter & things like that. It would be best to hand wash these, the handles tend to get fragile over time from the dishwasher. I bought a set may 2012, the small handle just broke but I really feel I got more than my money's worth. I am ordering these again. I've not had a chance to use these yet except to empty a soup can but I am impressed by them and believe they will hold up very well. The handles feel good, solid and easy to grip.

Vesta (my better half) and I are Burners. We go to Burning Man out in the Black Rock desert every year. If you haven't been, it's a week long gathering of about fifty thousand people in what are sometimes very harsh conditions. Google it if you're interested. They have porta potties out there, but in the middle of the night I just don't feel like getting out of my tent, putting on my shoes and hiking to one to take a pee or the other.<br /><br />So we bought one of these and a little red tent and some cat litter and some baking soda and some TP and some small but sturdy trash bags and made our very own loo. We set up the red tent next to our main tent, put the portable loo in the center of it, lined it with a trash bag, dumped some cat litter and baking soda in it and we were good to go. Literally.<br /><br />After peeing or pooing, you take off the seat, removed the trash bag, tie it up, replace with another bag, litter and soda, put the seat back on and you're good to go again.<br /><br />Burners take everything out of the desert with them, included pee and poo, so the cat litter and baking soda are very necessary, cuz the litter hardens the pee and the soda kills the smell.<br /><br />I can't say I'm in love with this portable loo, because who could love a toilet. However, I know this, I'd hate going to the desert without it.

I use my LED desk lamp almost every night.  I really love its modern and minimalist look.  It just feels so high tech.  The round base barely takes up any space on the end table at the side of my bed.  I like that it can fold up when not in use.  The three light color options come in handy depending on my mood and the five dimming levels allow for several brightness options throughout the day. The light feels really natural and doesn't flicker at all. The rating on the LED bulb life expectancy means I shouldn't have to replace the bulb for at least a couple decades! One of my best buys on Amazon!

Long before the phrase "it takes a village" was coined, our town of Gouyave had all the ingredients it took to raise good young men of high caliber like Collis DeCoteau. He has now returned the favor by encapsulating his experience as a young man growing up in that environment and makes no apologies; not that any is required.<br /><br /> "A Place Called Gouyave, is a masterfully well written book by Collis DeCoteau. He brought to the forefront, a time capsule that encompasses the liveliness of a people; their effervescent culture; their exuberance and their warmth which is and continues to be the foundation of our Gouyave people.<br /><br />In the only way it could have been written, DeCoteau's short stories reminded us of a culture that is commonly shared all over our Caribbean Islands on a grander scale but presented with that unique Gouyave flavor that he willingly shares. Yet, his book leaves room for a learning moment among the more sophisticated readers who seek to understand the foundation of our Caribbean people in general.<br /><br />It is a must read that will surely bring a smile to your faces especially as you reminisce about your own youthful experiences.<br /><br />-Vernon Louison

So I've bought 4 ultradiscs at this point, two i bought at REI, the other two off amazon.<br /><br />If you haven't already looked at this you should<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B007CZLABY/<br /><br />-if you're looking for a product made in the US, this is it<br />-if you're looking for a disc with an good balance of control, speed, and distance, this is it<br />-if you're looking for a disc that will last you for a good 5 years or (probably) more, so long as you don't chuck it at cement, trees or rooftops, this is it.<br /><br />the first disc I bought got roofed a few years back, and since then I needed a new disc, I considered whamoo, but found their discs were super flimsy and when I've tossed them they have way too much float for my taste.<br /><br />later I found the nite glow disc, and bought it of amazon, loved it, was just like my regular disc in shape/size/weight, and with age the glow improves. btw, the picture isn't exaggerated, the camera was just set at a very high film speed, I managed to get the same affect on my android phone by adjusting the ISO number to 1250.<br /><br />I recently purchased the ultraviolet disc, and love it as well. again, it's the same shape/size/weight as all the other ultrastar discs. the color changes when exposed to sunlight, the higher the UV level the faster and more dramatic the change in color from white to purple (in low UV conditions, like a cloudy day the disc may only turn a light pink color). when changing it back to white, it changes a lot faster when put in absolute darkness rather than just putting it in the shade.<br /><br />the only color i don't recommend is black, because on a hot summer day, the sunlight will actually cause the plastic of the disc to soften, thus allowing the disc to lose it's shape. My sister had a black disc, and although it looked cool, it was not good to leave it out in the sun.

Once I cracked open The Accidental Medical Writer, I couldn't put it down. I loved reading about how these two writers started their careers in medical writing. Granted, the book doesn't offer a step-by-step blueprint to follow to become a medical writer, but isn't that the point? Both authors took circuitous routes to their ultimate careers and that's what they wanted to communicate with this book. Before I read this book I was thinking about doing some writing for free, but now I'm convinced to heed their advice and always get paid to learn something new, especially writing.

This set of knives is perfect for cutting cheese whether you are a connoisseur or a casual lover of cheese (and really, who doesn't love cheese?). The wide blade has enough breadth for “scooping” soft, crumbly cheeses, and the pointed blade will have no problem working through any chunk of parmesan you pick up. If you're cooking dinner for two tonight, prepping your meals for the week, or throwing a large party over the weekend, you will only need to buy one set of cheese knives, and this is it. While the set comes with a lifetime warranty, this guarantee seems almost redundant, as the knives are so sturdy that I can't imagine any of them ever falling into disrepair. Take it from me: I love cheeses of all kinds, and owning this single set makes me feel even more inclined to explore new cheeses, for cooking and for eating off-the-block.

I have 2 Miniature Pinschers who bark at the least little things. Recently we've shifted in a Townhouse so my neighbors are right next to me. When I let them out in the yard they immediately start barking. I have tried spray bottles, whistle, shake a can with coins and nothing stopped my Gigi and Coko. After tons of searching, watching videos, reading reviews, and checking consumer sites I decided to get this one. Since I did not want to buy 2 at once. So, I decided to try out one collar.<br /><br />So far what I like:<br /><br />+ As stated above, it produces sound and vibration in order to trigger. No painful stuff.<br />+ It's easy to set once you know how, but it's not intuitive. You have to take the time to read the directions to get it set right.<br />+ I don't buy batteries every week. I use a rechargeable battery in it.<br />+ It has 7 sensitivity levels. I prefer to use as low as possible because I want to give my puppy time to learn rather than a strict treatment.<br />+ Waterproof which is very important.<br />+ No problem with eating food.<br /><br />What I would like to see improved:<br />I would prefer at least one minute interval of intensity than thirty seconds.<br /><br />My puppy seemed very offended by this new system just the way teenagers don't like losing privileges. I have been using it for a week now. i am going to order another.

This cover is well made, extremely functional and sturdy. It holds the 8&#34; Galaxy Tab 3 with a slip instead of the corner clips many cases have. I find this makes it more secure if it drops, and the only sacrifice is the covering of the border of the screen, which doesn't really matter to me. The black on black makes it unnoticeable. The design is just what I wanted, simple and functional. I also recommend the Invellop screen protector for added dust protection, especially if you take your tablet outside.

It's definitely wroth the buy, and it works, I was worried at first about the safety of my puppy, but after reading the description it's completely safe. He hasn't even barked nearly as much, and barely at all. My dog would slip out of all the other brands of collars, and He can't get out of this one, so that's a win!

Nine Kinds of Naked is a beautiful story, and Vigorito is a remarkable talent.

With an extensive wealth of knowledge in this field, I know what works and what doesn't as far as embroidery is concerned.<br />I was testing a range of stabilizers from different producers and this product from Sew Artsy was among the products I tried. I could not help but notice this product as it stood out from the rest in many ways. It provided an excellent level of support for your stiches, I was so impressed with the quality of stitches I got from the entire process. Of all the ones I tested, this stabilizer produced the best quality as compare to other stabilizers. Even after laundering the cloth, the effect of the stabilizer was not diminished as it retained the desired attributes.<br />I had to convince myself beyond all reasonable doubts. I mixed it with other samples and gave it to my friends to test for me and guess what? The confirmed my discovery, as far as they were concerned, it is an excellent product. With a huge variety of such products in the market, I have finally found one I can stick with. Thanks to the developers of this product as this is a true product of ingenuity and diligent research. It is highly recommended to anyone who needs a stabilizer. I give this product AN ALL STAR RATING. I cannot help but keep lots of them for future purposes. This is definitely an EXCELLENT VALUE FOR MONEY. I no more need to settle for less when I can have the best.

I ordered two of these meals for my husband and I during our most recent camping trip.  I've found that it works well with this: http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B0002YRNJK  I'd forgotten how big these meals were! We cooked two of these (one for each of us) plus a side of MHM veggies; it more than filled my husband up and I couldn't finish mine. I had to pass my leftovers to our buddy who was camping with us. As for my husband, he was full well before he finished his but &#34;powered through&#34; to finish it.   As for the taste, it was delicious and a welcomed hot meal during our times in the woods.  I hope this review was helpful. If you found this review helpful, please mark yes below.

I'm highly recommended this is great  Automatic Sliding Gate Opener Slide Operator..!!! I have been using  this my gate opener for 3 weeks  now and it is the  best money  I have spent in a long time.I have a 18' chain link gate and my  opener works perfectly. It's a little slow. With so many gate openers  on the market the price was  what really caught my eye. This is the best investment  in my home I've made  in awhile. Great product, and it's price is really so much reasonable.

&#34;Nothing bad to say here. The product works as advertised. It's just as it's been advertised in the title and description. Read through everything mentioned there and take a look at the pictures and you'll have a really good understanding of exactly what you're getting. The post here on Amazon is legit and the details are well cited.<br /><br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00IIB4YVE<br /><br />After purchasing a used unit and not being able to figure it out, I visited, in my local region, two libraries at two major universities. One was the library at the University of Wisconsin in Superior, WI and the other was the library at the University of Minnesota in Duluth, MN. I spoke with about ten students in each library and asked if they could help. All of them said &#34;&#34;No. I thought that maybe from talking to the students someone could enlighten me about the benefits of the unit. Finally I did some research online that helped answer my questions.<br /><br />If I could give 4 1/2 I would have. It does what I'm looking for, it's not 100% perfect but it's pretty darn good! I'd recommend it if you're in the market :D<br /><br />11/10, would recommend.<br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00UFHY8L0

They are reasonably priced and are long lasting due to being silicone, rather than rubber, silicone which does not dry rot and break down in our very dry desert weather low humidity.These silicone swim caps fit my largish head very firmly, so they could easily be worn by older children. They are shaped to fit comfortably around the ears and there are molded decorative lines on the scalp area and a scrolled border.Good Product with great quality.. long lasting must buy. works great while swimming !

Sensei Freedman has an incredibly inspiring story of growing up on the streets of Boston. This book does a good job to capture his personality and wit, and delivers powerful insights about the martial arts and some things to consider for becoming an ever-improving martial artist. He has a very scientific method for delivering martial arts lessons, and is very open minded and forward thinking, but adheres to and honors the traditions of the arts he teaches. A short, easy read full of great info that will remain on my dojo bookshelf.

This is a very decent liquid stevia product. This means that it is stevia suspended in water. So, it is still a little bit diluted, but 1 drop of this stuff is still just as sweet as 1 teaspoon of sugar. I also like the fact that you can cook with it in addition to putting in with your drinks. Actually, I think that this form works better for cooking than it does in the drinks. In fact, if you primarily use stevia for drinks, this would not be the best thing to use. In that case try this one: [[ASIN:B00HQ99OUK Pure Stevia Powder (3.5 oz)]].<br /><br />Be forewarned that this is very concentrated. I would start by only putting in a tiny amount at a time. Then, mix it and take a taste to see. Believe me, a little goes a long way with this! Also, I find that this product does mix and dissolve very well. Plus, you may even find that it helps to boost your mood.

Taking this test can be rather intimidating, but if you've taken something very similar to the real test in advance, you might feel better about how you would do.  These practice questions have things in them that are very similar to what the test would have on it.  So when you take these practice tests, it will feel like the real thing.  You can then score yourself and see how you would do on the test.  If there are areas you need to work on, you have time to study those things before the test.  Knowing what you need to work on in advance is to your advantage for sure!

I ordered these bags late Sunday night and received them on Wednesday. I have only used two of the bags so far but so far I Love them.  I love that. It makes storing use and keeps them clean and fresh until I need them. When I go to move, this will make moving easy. It will keep the items clean and together. The only advise I can give is to make sure you squeeze the white slider when closing the bag, I did not do that on my first bag and I could not figure out what I was doing wrong. Then I found the instructions and now every thing works out great. I thought I was going to have to buy 2 sets of bags but after I see how much I can stuff in a bag, I won't have to. I plan on using the leftover bags in camper to help with our storage.

I haven't used the Müeller spiralizer a ton yet, but I am super excited about it! I initially ordered another, less expensive brand and ended up cancelling my order after discovering it hadn't been shipped 5 days after I had placed my order. The one reason why I chose Müeller over other brands is that I hear/read so much about how wonderful the costumer service is. I began to read reviews as saw that the owners or at least a representative for Müeller had answered a large majority of the reviews or complaints. That is super impressive to me. SO- I cancelled my other order and ordered one from here. It shipped and I got it 3 days earlier than I expected. So far- I am a happy and excited gal!

Unfair is a fascinating read, exposing the inherent flaws that exist in our criminal justice system because of the inherent flaws of those that developed it, those who enforce it, it and those who it is intended to protect; in short, everyone.  The author uses real-life examples, cases, and scientific and psychological experiments to demonstrate just how susceptible our justice system is to human fallibility.  In one of the early chapters, for example, he uses the tragic case of David Rosenbaum, the award-winning New York Times journalist, to highlight how one mistaken assumption (that David was passed out because he was drunk - not because he had been struck and mugged, which was the reality) led to a series of oversights by police and medical professionals.  Once the mistake was realized, it was too late, and David died from head injuries.  However, as soon as his identify was known, as a respected and well -known writer, the biases swung in his favor - the perpetrator was identified, convicted and sentenced harshly.  Reforms to emergency and police procedures were passed in D.C., certainly tied to the victim's prominent and respected social standing.<br /><br />The book goes on to make sense of the seemingly irrational nature of false confessions; present the actual differences in &#34;normal&#34; and criminal brains; expose the predictability of cheating - from students to prosecutors; explore the unreliable nature of memory; discuss the obvious but oft overlooked fact that judges are humans, too! And the list goes on.<br /><br />I've never written a book review, but I felt compelled to do so for this book.  It is not only fascinating, but an extremely important subject that affects us all.  By educating ourselves about the science that dictates our every single thought and action, we can better understand how our justice system should be designed to ensure it can actually serve its purpose.  The book presents a number of easy first steps - some already being implemented - that can minimize the affect our biases have on the justice system - and also digs deeper, pushing the reader to grapple with the very nature of criminal behavior and how we as a society have been taught to view it.  I would highly recommend this interesting, enjoyable and important book.

Earlier, it was clumsy to have the toilet brushes rested across the wall. By using Champ Grip, it makes the washroom look clean and organized! It comes with 6 screws on which the organizer stands, due to which it does not come off at any point of time.

I have never been to Kodiak Island; I don't own a gun; I don't own a bow: I have never shot a duck, goose, pheasant, wild turkey, deer or elk.  I am, and have always been, a city dweller.  My dad did not leave when I was small.  I was not raised by my mother and grandmother.  I am old enough for Sowers to be my son.  One would assume Sowers and I have little in common except our gender.  However, I like real stories about real people.  The stories Sowers tells are real.  Sowers is &#34;real.&#34;  He opens his heart and soul, holds nothing back; his fears, failures, shortcomings, doubts, thoughts.  He puts it all &#34;out there.&#34;  No, actually he brings you &#34;in there,&#34; into his real life, his real feelings, his real everything.  As Sowers permitted me to be a part of his private life, I found myself going in a different direction.  Although I started the journey in to his mind and heart, I found myself walking a different path, my path, my past, my life, my heart, my soul, my failures, my fears, my shortcomings, my questions, deep personal and spiritual questions. At one point I stopped, closed the book, meditated about what I have just read and wondered, &#34;How could someone so &#34;young&#34; have so much insight, wisdom and thoughts that are supposed to occur when you are my age!?  Reflecting upon the book, I have concluded Sowers had some help; divine I suspect.  Although there no &#34;preachy&#34; words or phrases anywhere in the book, make no doubt about it, the book is deeply spiritual.  It comes from a place deep within a writer who obviously has a genuine connection to the Source from which he draws much of what makes this book so special, so relevant, so personal and so vital.  I frankly think his book has something for every man, the best book of its type since Wild At Heart.  But this one will take you deeper within yourself than Wild At Heart.  I am curious to see how the book resonates with a the fairer gender.

I purchased this dog collar for three of my dogs that I love a lot, but they bark terribly especially at night time. It was getting to the point that I wouldn't be able to get to sleep at night time so I had to do something about it. My good friend advised that I get a no bark collar, so I looked for online for one and discovered this one. This collar is effective, and until now I have no motive to think it has any negative side effects on my dogs. I can basically count the quantity of times they bark per night time now...if they even do! Thank you so much, because now I can rally sleep and wake up rested every morning!

You don't even need to use a muffin pan to use them. You can place them filled on a baking sheet and they won't open. They are non stick and you don't have to add a cooking spray on them. Once the item is cooled the food item comes out without a hassle. They are easy to wash and you can even use them in the dishwasher. They are microwavable safe so u can cook in the microwave in half the time. I can't wait to see what recipes I can come up with in them.

I was so excited to get this coffee grinder.  It's a well made and design coffee grinder.  Really easy to use and maintain. The burr is made from durable ceramic, which the ground coffee won't have metal smell and will never rust.  The metal parts are stainless steel, which are durable too.  Another great design is at the bottle of the grinder there is an anti-slip silicone cover, which can prevent the grinder from slipping around and better delivering the force when grinding coffee beans. The grind adjustment nut inside allows you to grind coffee powder into different sizes (finer or coarser) Pros: Nice design Easy to use Made from durable materials (ceramic, silicone, heatproof glass, stainless steel) Easy to clean Can adjust the coffee grind I didn't find any cons yet.  My husband and I both really love this grinder.  Excellent product!

My girlfriend and I won't drink a glass without it. And if we forget and poor the wine directly in the glass we poor it from that glass into another using the aerator. This is my first so I cannot compare it to the competitors. Performs as advertised; it's an instant decanter, bringing out the best a &#34;red&#34; has to offer.

I had earlier bought Dr. Navadia's ECG Short Rapid Review , it was awesome and was searching some books related to Cardiology. I came across many books with more than 20 , five star comments..... Wait !!!! How can be that much feedbacks in a week and then rest of 6-12 months , not a single feedback ? All of which were self reviewed and so thought to buy this book after seeing Table of Content in it. Never go on feedbacks.<br /><br />And as usual , Dr. Navadia's book rocks ...I am a medic & i find this book explains every thing what a medic must know - It explains all relationships , drugs , non-pharm therapy etc . see table of content for more details.<br /><br />For common people, there is more than enough information which might be not usefull for them. DASH Diet is explained in short summary in 2-3 Pages (Go for detailed DASH Diet book if u want to move with it). So for them i would give 4 star for this book ...but for medics i will give 5++ star.<br /><br />In short , i would say , if u want to know more , go for this book , you will not regret your purchase , Thats my opinion... but if u just want to know only How to manage without doctors advice or only few things , then , better buy another book.

The installation is not terribly difficult.  You do need to shorten the straps that hold up your kayak if you want to hang it close to the ceiling. The straps are pretty long and if you don't fold them over or shorten them, your kayak will droop pretty low.

Just switch on the speaker to connect my phone to Bluetooth, then place the call over the speaker. I can hear the caller very clearly and the caller can hear my voice just fine. I'm glad this Bluetooth speaker has solved my problem.I think it is a very great Bluetooth speaker.Worth recommending!

I'm curious why someone thought this was expensive for 12 cards... If you do the math it comes to less than $2 each... You aren't going to find this high quality of a card in a retail store for any less, I haven't been able to at least. Anyhow, my honest opinion is the quality is great, the covers are very funny and everyone loves getting a funny card on Christmas.. For the price and free Prime shipping it's a win/win in my book.

My friend recommended this product.I bought it so that i can connect my OLD TV and it was perfect for me. Initially i thought this was a signal converter until i read description, it wasn't what i thought.I knew most people would have mistaken it for signal converter as well. If you want to use this transmitter cable it is best you get yourself a signal converter box. Not until i got myself a signal converter before i could use it. Now i connect without stress to my TV from the converter.<br /><br />Lastly, to avoid any damage its best you ensure both input and output devices are off when plugging or unplugging HDMI cables.<br /><br />Thanks

First off I have LOTS more experience with my cheaper: http://fave.co/1c3BOHL  This thing is surprisingly bright. From a meter away, ISO 100, it gives a 2.8 split.  A rather peculiar thing is that to my eyes the 126 led light seems brighter. When doing a light check with my light meter, a nice sekonic digital one, it was reading half a stop brighter than the 160 light one. That's funny, more lights equal less power. I did a test right up on the light source and the f-stop at 100 iso was 16.3 for both of them. I assume for some reason the drop off is faster on the 160 unit. The 160 led unit does however have a greater spread, and considering the vignette this is an advantage because more area is flatly lit.  The reason I give this a rating 5 is because the color temp is off. It is too blue, slightly green. This is no surprise considering the price. It is also why one of the gels that comes with it is -green. But I feel that the gels that they give are too strong for cine work. The -green only needs to be a 1/4 maybe 1/2, not a full. Now skin tone is too red; a nice gesture at least. Another con of the unit is that it is obviously more bright in the center of the light and then there is an uneven vignette to the rest. This is not specific to this 160 unit, I also ordered a 126 led unit and have the same issue. You can easily fix this by reflecting the light or putting on some black foil, but built in barn doors would be a practical addition.  In short get the:  http://fave.co/1c3BPLM  This might seem like a lot of complaints, but for the price this is expected and still worth purchasing  I hope this helps!

As a mini-bike enthusiast for the past 10 or so years, this is a great mini-bike! I've probably logged about 30 or so hours without having any issues. The bike is super durable and has taken quite a beating on the trails by my house.<br /><br />The bike has a solid 79.5cc ohv engine that can haul and I personally think it looks pretty sweet compared to other minis out there. Shipping was quick, bike came in un-damaged and the assembly was straight-forward. Would (and have) recommend to friends or anyone looking for a very fun ride. Even if you're not an enthusiast, this is a perfect item to just have fun with and is easy to operate. 5/5.

After having researched LED desk lamps I decided to purchase this one.<br />Being a student it's a stuff that I need to use every day.<br />The features appeared to be what I have been looking for; plus, I think that it is attractive.<br />The lamps are slender and very light weight. They require only a small amount of space,<br />so there is no cluttered appearance on my dresser or nightstand.<br />Light switches are not required for this lamp,<br />I simply just touch the aluminum alloy structure to dim or brighten the light.<br />I love these handy little lamps.

&#34;I've always wanted a &#34;Victorian&#34; style bathroom, and looking for basketweave mosaic tiles for the floor. They are a perfect compliment to the white beadboard, and european sink. The point is here if you have larger than 30 sqft floor size, this is the tile you should look for as it is a large size basketweave marble mosaic and you dont use to much grout lines and makes it easy to clean and beautiful look on the floor. I dont recommend it less than 30 sqft area floors.<br />I had my contractor install them so it is professional touch into it. I really love the overall look.

I bought this last year, and have been used it for 4 events now. Mainly for christening, gatherings and celebrations. This camcorder is the best video recorder I have ever used. Why? because it's really great for low light and it has a great dynamic range. The footage with 30db noise is not that bad if you'll look at it on a big screen, I also love the batteries! You can consume the 16gb card at full HD 24p without dropping a single battery bar. The only negative side I found was the lack of shutter control, it does have a slow shutter but it's an automatic compensation. And hey! It has a 3 ring control for IRIS(aperture), Zoom(it actually has 3 zoom controls) and focus! Name the feature and it's there. This is better than shooting DSLR. In terms of picture quality, it's sharp, slow motion is smooth and great noise reduction technology.

My son, daughter, and their cousins (ages 10 - 12) were outside all weekend long on this bike (and another Monster Moto minibike and go kart), perfect for the Texas hill country.  The graphics are terrific, required almost no assembly, and it was easy to start and reliable.  I cant believe the price (I would pay more)!  Makes the outdoors more enjoyable!

My newborn would not take a &#34;binky&#34; and I had a hard time finding things to soothe her in the car or just out and about until I saw this and decided to give it a try. It was like a little miracle for her. The music is just enough to get her attention and the little bugs are adorable. The best part is that it turns itself off after about 20 min which is great because I always forget and she is usually asleep by then. It comes with attachments for a crib or pack and play and also for the stroller. It's just so convenient.

Then when my best friend and I were watching the 20/20 special on the movie, she mentioned that it was her favorite musical. So, when I went to buy her a Blu Ray copy, I saw all the features this, THIS 50th anniversary version has on it. And it's AWESOME. If you're a fan of the movie, spend the extra bucks and get this 5-disc version. All the bonus features are excellent and thoroughly enjoyable. WELL worth the extra money.

These pens are absolutely fantastic!  It works well with this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008G8G8Y?tag=i60-20  I had originally been turned on to these pens when I had come across an article showing that these Sakura pens had the best chemical, heat, and moisture resistance.  Found here: [...]  Ink stability is tantamount in a notebook for company or personal use. I can write with confidence knowing that my writing won't smear or fade and possibly lead me in a touchy legal situation.  I also really like the fact that the caps STAY on the opposite ends when writing, unlike some pens which don't positively lock on and fall off, eventually being lost.  My only gripe is that I'm often afraid of bending the tips of the smaller diameter pens.  I use these pens at work in labs to document my findings and observations, as well as to draw any intellectual property that may be used in legal disputes. REMEMBER, your word is only as good as your documentation, engineers!  Side note: A lot of the people who use the pens are incorrectly describing the sizes. The pen designation is a #005 and not it's diameter, not .005in, or 0.005mm. That #005 is 0.20mm in diameter, the &#34;&#34;#&#34;&#34; does not directly correlate to the pen diameter.

The pocket for my laptop charger keeps it neatly tucked away, other bags you have to put it in with everything else and it makes the bag more bulky but the charger is on the side and not in the way.

The good: -Battery lasts more than 1.5 hours and it is more than enough for BOB to cover the whole place multiple times over -Great with dog hair -Always returns to charging station which seems to be an issue for some other owners based on the reviews I had read prior to purchase. We have a straight forward floor plan with a large rectangular living room/kitchen and two bedrooms on each end. We have put the charging station is the living room and Bob has never missed it! The bad: The kitchen table is Bob's biggest challenge (and my biggest annoyance with Bob). He somehow manages to get under there sometimes and tries to get out some other way to no avail. When I am not there, I don't notice the struggle and Bob eventually seems to gets out as I have never found him dead there. but if I am there, Bob's dumb moves and prolonged helplessness (I have even observed a 10-minute struggle once) get on my nerves.

This is my favorite copy & printing paper.<br /><br />I've found that it works well with this:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BB5DJU6/<br /><br /> Georgia-Pacific was recommended to me years ago by a copier franchise owner. He told me it would not produce a lot of messy dust in the copier/printer as other papers do. I have been using it ever since. I have always liked the 5-ream pack-see GP Copy & Print Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 20 Lb, 5 Reams/Carton (2500 Sheets). It's convenient, but was not available this time with &#34;&#34;Amazon Prime&#34;&#34; shipping. In fact, the price was much higher (not being sold by Amazon). So, I saw these 3-ream cartons with &#34;&#34;Prime.&#34;&#34; Like the 5-ream, these are easy to carry, compared to the bigger boxes of ten reams. I have always found the price to be one of the best bargains. It looks like Amazon is going to keep it like that. One of my main complaints about having paper like this delivered is that they so often come &#34;&#34;beat-up!&#34;&#34; Then, you have to go through the whole process of returning it. What a pain! I think we all hate that! Right? What's the use? Not this time! These came from the manufacturer in a thicker than normal cardboard box which seemed to resist shipping damage. Hopefully, this is where I will buy all my paper in the future.<br /><br />Update: 4/5/2014 -- Almost a year later, this is where I have bought most of my paper since. I am extremely satisfied with this paper, the size of the box, the convenience, the packing (if you buy more than one box), basically everything! And, in all this time I have not had a &#34;&#34;beat-up&#34;&#34; box of paper delivered.<br /><br />Update: 8/27/2014 -- I have tried other deals on the 10-Ream Cartons GP Spectrum Premium Multi Use Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 10 Reams/Carton (5000 Sheets) that occasionally appear, but each time the office staff has asked that we go back to using this economical, very convenient and easy to handle 3-Ream Pack.<br /><br />Update: 2/18/2015 -- I tried GP Spectrum® 96 Multipurpose Paper at a good price. Still, I keep coming back to this best of all bargains in copy paper.

It lacks content. This game, while fun, is just not worth full price.<br /><br />I hated my:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00KME8K9C<br /><br />No fanboy can deny that. Single player starts off ok before devolving into a check the block COD knock off. The arrest mechanic, while fun at first, gets repetitive since bad guys react the same way every time. AI is just awful. But hey, who plays battlefield for single player, right? Hotwire and heist multiplayer modes are great. Conquest mode is neutered without attack helicopters and tanks. Sure it's a cops and robbers game, but if you are going to throw in a classic mode than Visceral/DICE shouldn't have been so lazy about it. They could have themed it to allow for the fun stuff. After all, they have tanks and attack choppers in the campaign. The few 5v5 modes are not worth your time as Counter-strike does them better. There are a few balancing issues and bugs that need to be ironed out, but overall it runs well. There is hardly any destruction outside of levolution events, which kind of makes sense so that people may use the grappling hook and a few other gadgets, but it's still a disappointment none the less. My biggest gripe is the overall lack of content. EA promised us that Hardline would have the same amount of content as BF4. That was a lie. You only get a few guns per class. Take the enforcer class for example, you get to choose between 2 shotguns or 2 medium range rifles. If you don't like any of those then you are sh$% out of luck. Same thing goes for pistols and for some reason they are locked to certain classes. Why can't I carry a Beretta or glock in the mechanic class? It seems to me like they stripped a lot of content to later sell as DLC, which is what this game should have been... themed DLC. While I cannot recommend at full price, I do recommend it if you can get it for $30 or less. Or just skip it all together since BF4 is running great and better titles are coming out this year. At full price - 2.5/5 stars.

This is one (or 3) of the few movies that I'd say is very long but will never get tired of watching even for the &#34;nth&#34; time. It's a multi-generational crime saga everybody should see. One of the best American films that has ever been created, I will definitely judge anyone who hasn't seen the trilogy yet. It's really amazing. Describing it as amazing would be an understatement. As for the restoration, it's a job well done but I still want to watch it in its original grainy copy. It just feels so real and nostalgic and mafia-ish and all. If you've seen the trilogy and actually liked it, I'm sure you'll also love Scarface, American Gangster, Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects.

These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B008BXB76Y DRE Phones http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00E9262IE  But they are the best I've heard in the sub $100 price range. Possibly comparable to these Sennheisers Earbuds http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B001EZYMF4  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00V3L7WME  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Pros + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode and not stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00V3L7WME

I was very happy and impressed right from the start with the high quality feel and look of this knife! High quality metal feels good to the grip, a surprisingly ultra bright light for its size, nice fire starter that really works and shoots out good sized sparks. Although it is a bit on the small size but still effective. I tested it and it did start a fire for me. I don't really have much use for the window breaker and seatbelt cutter, yet. But if the occasion arises, it's great to know I'll be ready to help save a life. Altogether, I am very pleased with this knife. Especially for the price!! I think this knife is actually underpriced for its quality and all it has to offer. Just my opinion.

If your good USA-made tools have wondered off over the years due to children, family, friends etc like mine, this set may fill a partial void. It has for me.  If you haven't already looked at this you should: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FLUB76?tag=i60-20  Something to beware of: Tool manufacturers to include those of flashlights are stamping items &#34;&#34;U.S.A.&#34;&#34; vs &#34;&#34;Made in U.S.A.&#34;&#34; due to some or most of a widget's parts/build process being performed offshore then in some fashion assembled in USA.  About the set: Heavy steel; lengths: 12&#34;&#34; OAL w/a ~2.1&#34;&#34; jaw drop, 9.5&#34;&#34;OAL w/a ~ 1.2&#34;&#34; jaw drop, and 6.75&#34;&#34;OAL w/a ~ 0.75&#34;&#34; jaw drop while closed; very good thick rubber-type handle coverings which actually feel thicker than my 40-y/o set (could be due to wear); exposed metal has some sort of heavy lacquer finish for corrosion prevention, something I don't recall on old set; water pump pivot pin is a big rivet vs lag bolt w/ self-locking nut...Hmmm, I personally like those w/ self-locking nut (older ones same size have) but perhaps the larger size pumps made today have lags/SL nuts, not sure.  The `apex' screwdriver is stamped &#34;&#34;CHANNELLOCK&#34;&#34; which means something in itself; has a 'corn cob' handle -- it's beefy by comparison and should perform well esp with longer high-carbon cross-tip bits.  If you're a picky B when it comes to hand tools, I think you'll like this set.  Update: Something's odd with screwdriver (shaft pulls from handle - I finally figure out lol). It has a reversible 5/16 inch bit (Phillips/flat) which has a receiver ball to remain attached.  And, apparently a bit with same type receiver ball (1/4inch bit) must be used on opposing side (ordinary bits fall right out lol)...hmmm

I just bought this awesome starry sets of LED lights, from this seller as a friend recommended me to do so because I had been looking for them at big stores. I did not like what the stores where offering  they looked weak to me, and very low quality. I tried some and they stopped working after a couple of days, and had a too heavy battery pack. I wanted to use them on my bike, to light the wheels, and heavy is not good for that. But these ones I bought here, besides beeing unexpensive compared to the fantastic effect they provide, they are very lightweight, (good for hanging the battery holder on the bicycle), they give just the right amount of brightness for riding on it, the copper wire can be easily adapted to the shape of the wheel, and can be stuck to it with tape easily. I am very happy with them. I contacted the seller as I want more colors, so every kid in the family and my wife can use a different color on their bike. They don't serve them now, but in the future will do. I am going to wait for this brand, as I know for sure I will get a good quality ones. Can't wait to see the other colors.

This product has many features and does everything that it has promised. I was having some troubles with my car battery and it dying. I didn't really know what to do about the problem and I wanted to have something in place just in case it would die. I used this when my car died and it was perfect! I can rest assured that this product will have my back no matter what happens to my car. I have also used this product as a phone charger. My phone dies a lot while I am driving and having this to charge it has really made that much more of a difference!

Great short cables, they even come in pairs with mirror plugs so you can use on the side you prefer.<br />I bought it for FireTV stick, but I wouldn't have bought so many (one for each fire stick) if I new there were 2 on each bag, and specially if I knew it's only a microUSB to USB cable... of wich I have several from every cel phone or tab I've had for the last years... still - very useful! (I'm connecting my phone to my computer with one of those now, they're so short they don't occupy almost any space)

Like all the other Lego games, this one is just as good. The story is obviously from the movie and it's fun to be able to relate to it. It's a great game that suit both parents and kids I think. On the x-box I play with my 9 year old son, and it's a really good game to be able to play together. The games goes on even if one of us has to drop out for a bit and it's easy to just join up again. Nothing is too hard in the game. Unlike other games where you can get stuck on levels, that doesn't happen here. I can't think of anything negative to say about this game. It's just a very user friendly game. A++++ Can't wait for more Lego games.

Great addition for our camping trips equipment, the emitted is LED so that makes the power and quality of the light to be very strong, the fan is perfect for that moment in the night when you can't sleep because of the heat. I used it in our last camping trip with my son and it lasted all night long, which is great considering it is batteries what power this. It also is very lightweight which is something we were looking for, as we like to pack light. Overall, is a very useful tool for the camping amateurs like my son and I

After my 12yr old water heater started leaking I bought this N-120 model. I had it installed and very happy with the purchase! We set it at maximum. During a quick test to get the air out of the system we turned on all the faucets. 3 sinks and two showers. All set at FULL HOT. The only one that didn't get as hot was the one furthest away from the water heater. I would recommend this unit to any one. I also freed up space in my utility room. This unit sits on the wall and I can now add shelving where the tank used to be.

I searched Amazon high and low for the perfect case for my 7&#34; Galaxy Tab. There weren't any that looked good, were thin and lightweight and had a working stand. Then I found this case and I can't be more happy. I attend a number of meetings and needed a case that worked well while I use SuperNote Pro. Adaptive positioning with the case simple. The case is constructed well and my Tab seems to be well protected. Also works really great while watching movies on the airplane.<br /><br />My only suggestion would be a stylus holder since there is no room inside the case to hold my stylus.

Just replaced my old PVC kick mats with the newer version and they are so much better. I have installed one on the back of the drivers seat and the other on the back of the passengers seat, they both fit and look nice on my Honda CRV.

I ordered this mask recently after disappointment in several others. I am really pleased with it. The silk is very soft. It is lightweight on your face. It is not too tight and can be adjusted. It covers very well and does not allow light in. The elastic strap does not cause discomfort on the back of your head nor does it entangle your hair. I am a back and side sleeper and this mask doesn't slide around even when I toss and turn. There is nothing that I don't like about this lovely mask!

My other son is 7, and I found picking up a splitter to be a great way for them to watch movies on the same tablet. This is the one I got: http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0044FSSMY  These headphones are an excellent value for the money. My son is around 3 and I have always hesitated putting headphones on her when she is on her Fire HD Kids Tablet. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00LOR524M  While this is the feature I wanted, if you are in a very loud area or on a plane that is fairly loud (small ones where you are close to engines), then they don't work the best. He sometimes had a hard time hearing the sound even with these maxed out.  These changed my thinking. I also chose these because they have the reduced volume feature to protect his hearing. I tried these on and had my volume turned all the way up and they were about 75% of the normal max volume. They are also fairly sturdy, I wouldn't be afraid of them breaking unless you actually tried to break them.  I would buy again, but be wary if you are only going to use them on planes or in high noise areas.  I highly recommend if you are looking for good headphones for your child buy these. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00503KPYS

The quality and taste of this green tea is phenomenal. I love making a cup of this tea for breakfast-- it is soothing and tastes good. It's also good after dinner, to help relax and de-stress. This tea is organic and non-gmo, carefully prepared and packaged. I really appreciate the fact that it does not contain pesticides. It is pure and clean, with a mild green flavor. I dont add any sugar or sweetner to my hot tea, although some people like it sweet. To create a frappe, I mix it with coconut milk and ice cubes in the vitamixer. Highly recommended if you like Green Matcha tea.

It truly shocks me that people with labs (and other aggressive chewing breeds) think this toy will hold up with their dogs and then write bad reviews on it when it doesn't. Come on people, you know your dogs! If you have a strong chewer, you should know a plush toy like this (or ANY plush toy for that matter!) will never hold up under all the punishment and abuse their love of chewing and tearing will dish out. This is not meant for strong chewers and rippers. No plush toy is. So please don't trash this excellent dog toy because you made a poor decision based on your dog's breed.<br /><br />The fact is, this is a GREAT toy for light to moderate chewers. It's very well made and holds up great as long as you don't have an aggressive chewer. My Pembroke Corgi adores hers and spends many happy evenings playing with it. I love that it allows us to play together since I do have to 'restuff' the log every so often. But that's a nice way to spend time with my puppy and we both enjoy how fun this toy is.<br /><br />Honestly, this is one toy you can't go wrong with as long as you know your dog and don't buy it for an aggressive chewer. There are lots of tougher toys out there just for them!

I was a bit worried when I bought this since it had somewhat mixed reviews, but I bought it anyway since the reviews were more geared towards the positive side. The main complaints I saw were durability of the chrome plating. I can assure you I've used this controller almost every day for 4 months now and all the gold plating is there.<br /><br />The only bad thing is that small surface scratches do show up, but that is to be expected with this type of finish. You ever have a cell phone LCD screen show small scratches that are barely even noticeable? That's what happened to mine, but they are minimal. It didn't get too many fingerprints on it.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, this held up better than my white controller that came with my console. My original white controller has worn thumbsticks (that are actually loose and have no grip) and the white controller built up a ton of dirt. This controller still looks almost as nice as when I took it out of the package. But then again maybe its because I kept better care of it since I love it so much :)<br /><br />Anyway, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone. It is durable, the mod is awesome, and the service provided by Geniusmods has been great. 5 stars in my book!

Doctor King's organic Japanese matcha is fresh, green, smells great and tastes very good. For anyone that is new to matcha, here are a couple of my favorite matcha recipes.  To make a matcha latte, I sift one teaspoon or two grams of matcha onto 8 oz of hot milk (160 F). I blend the matcha and milk with a hand blender and pour it into a latte glass. Sift a little matcha on top. Lovely! It has a light bright green color and is delicious! Sometimes I make matcha tea with this matcha - it's quite nice. Unlike some others brands I've tried, Doctor King's matcha is not bitter.  I love smoothies. Here is how I make a Matcha Super Smoothie. I use organic vegetables and fruit. I put a handful of organic spinach, one stick of celery. some cucumber, water 4 oz, ice 4 oz, organic Japanese matcha 1/2 teaspoon, one kiwi fruit, one pear, one apple and a couple of berries into a blender. Blend until smooth. Serve in a glass. I say &#34;drink it and feel super!&#34;  I have taken a few pics. I took the pics in a glass in bright lighting. I find that if you look at the matcha in a darker part of the kitchen or in a mug, you don't see the color so well. This product is a very good buy. It is definitely worth trying! :)

I purchased the InSassy TM Expandable 75ft hose because I just moved to my new place and there was a lot of lawn and trees to water, and I wanted something light weight.  Due to my surprise when I received the package, it was light and arrived quickly; I was already excited to use the hose.  From reading previous reviews, how the hose pops and what not, I read the instructions that came with the hose to make sure I didn't use it wrong. The instructions were easy to understand, which I liked since I do not want to waste time trying to figure out how to use to hose.<br />It has been almost 2 months since I purchased the hose from InSassy and it has been a great product, the hose does not kink, durable and light and it has cut my chores to half the time. I have a busy schedule since I have to juggle work, kids and chores; this InSassy TM Expandable 75ft hose has saved me a lot of time and money. I would recommend this product with 2 thumbs up. Thank you, InSassy for making my life easier.

This is absolutely PERFECT for exactly what I wanted. In my very small space I don't have room for a file cabinet. I wanted a wall system to file my active project folders, and happy colors to brighten up the space. At the same time, it is relatively flat against the wall/roof so it doesn't crowd my desk space or my elbow. It is easy to access the folders and return them to their resting place, so it keeps my desk clear and my visual space (and mind) uncluttered. Then I can collect it into a compact package so I can carry it to a better heated space when the weather is so cold it gets too drafty in my attic office. Did I mention that my attic walls are slanted? The folders don't fall out. The material is a poly type, so someday I expect that the corners might get brittle an crack a little, but I imagine by then I will be ready for a bit of decorative change--I figure that's what washi tape is for. The colorful liners DO come with the system.

I was skeptical when I purchased this Chalkseries Chalkboard contact paper because I have already bought my fair share of disappointing generic chalkboard contact papers- the thin flimsy ones that don't hold chalk nearly as well as they are supposed to. However, I decided to take a chance with this one although it is more pricey than the generic  Con-Tact brand.<br /><br />As almost always with FBA, the items arrived within 3 days. The retail box looks amazing-  the company definitely put some great thought into it.<br /><br />I cut an 18 inches x 2 feet portion and applied this on my bedroom wall. I instantly realized that this chalkboard contact paper is different from the rest- it has a much thicker material (which later on I will find to be the main reason why this product is superior). I was able to apply it perfectly without leaving any air bubbles trapped underneath.<br /><br />After using this for 2 days, there are a few things I can comment on in detail.<br /><br />1. It holds chalk EXTREMELY well and when you erase with a dry cloth, almost all the chalk marks are removed. NONE of the chalkboard contact papers I have previously used comes close to the quality of this product.<br /><br />2. No "scratch" marks are left behind even when you do write hard.<br /><br />3. If you want to "reset" the chalkboard, wipe it with a damp cloth, and your chalkboard will look absolutely brand new. Not a single smudge will be left behind.<br /><br />In conclusion, I admit that it's obvious that I have nothing but praises for this product. I would give this product a 9.5 out of 10, only because I wish it was as cheap as the generic contact papers out there! But I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. When all is said and done, this product is DEFINITELY worth buying if you are fed up with chalkboard contact papers that are mediocre!

First make sure you pick up a http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00CD8AFT8 It'll help a lot. Seriously, you pay this much for a laptop. Either that or get something like a http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00EEBS9O0  Cons: *There is a lot of flex in the screen directly in front of the keyboard. Very scary to grab anywhere on near the screen with any force. *The touchpad can be frustrating. It can't be used with games at all. Right click is near impossible sometimes. This is probably the worst thing about the computer to be honest. I am getting used to it, but really there isn't a way around this thing if you use it in your lap like I do. * No touchscreen. It would be better with one, but it's not really necessary. *Windows 8. This is probably just personal preference because it's totally usable, but I don't use the windows 8 homescreen in the least. I stay on desktop and that's it. *When I received the laptop, the top part of the screen was separated but clicked right together. No big deal. *I have noticed some scaling issues. Google Chrome does not scale whatsoever with the 1080p screen, so everything is very small on the screen. This is easily fixed by using Firefox, which scales perfectly. I'm not really tech-savvy enough to know why it does this (without googling...). Haven't had many more scaling issues other than with chrome. *All of the ports are on the right side. Someone may have an issue with this, but I don't. *The charger is a little difficult to plug in.  Pros: *Awesome display! 1080p is really beautiful on the matte screen. Works well in the sunlight as well as indoors and in the dark. *KILLER keyboard. I came from an older toshiba satellite, and I thought it had a good keyboard. http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00SXX975K Nope, this is what good is. The keys are perfectly spaced, backlit in red, no spacebar issues like I had read on other reviews. The keyboard is probably one of my favorite aspects about this computer. *Graphics card is good. I can't playSkyrim at ultra high quality with no lag whatsoever but it's good. *Huge amount of space in the hard drive. I really don't know how I'll ever use near that much. *The case is beautiful. *Huge touchpad *3 USB ports *The speakers are really great. I could actually sit and watch a movie on this, or play any game clearly in a crowded room if needed. *Wi-Fi works, I have had no issues at all connecting or having slow speeds. *Super thin and lightweight *Earlier Windows software can be easily used on Windows 8 if needed.  In the end this is a great purchase: http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00R45UGBC  I hope this review was helpful!

Firstly, I'm a High School Math Teacher, at the beginning of the year I told my students to start looking in to getting a graphing calculator, preferably a TI-83/84 as that is what I am accustomed to. But after seeing one of my students use an Nspire CX and its ease of use for graphing purposes I was sold to getting one. Now why get a CX CAS firstly its only a few dollars and you get a whole lot of fucntionality. the CAS is overkill for the lower level math classes as you will not be using many of the built in functions. But in higher level math such as calculus the CX CAS does everything for you, makes problem solving easier so long as you understand the concept. the CAS version does a great job at derivatives and integration, and allows for exact answers unlike that of Non-CAS versions

It works, but it's kind of an expensive way to control one device via your iPhone, but if you need to do that, this works fine. Right now we're using it to control a light in the living room. Not because we have to or need to, but because we can. My husband was very excited about the tech aspect of this, so now he's turning on the light and turning it off when we're out to dinner, so it looks like we're home. He'll get tired of that and I expect that we'll find a good use for this down the road. But as I said in my opening sentence this works and it works just like it's supposed to.

The charger also seems to charge the batteries in about an hour, which is definitely an upgrade from my ancient Craftsman drill. This drill is great for anyone looking to do home improvement, or like me, even on the job site. The drill seems to have great torque and my favorite feature of it is the chuck. I like being able to put a bit an and twist the chuck without it spinning (might not be a new feature, but my Craftsman lacked that). Overall, great value for a great brand. Recommended.

I have been into endurance sports for 3 years already as a varsity runner at my school and 10Ks on my own.  I already have some experiences with different brands of heart rate monitors.  I have had some different ones and my teammates have used a few other brands too.   So far I am very pleased with this HeartQ monitor.    I was pleased to see that it has all of the functionality I need on my long runs - like the tracker and calorie counter.  The last monitor I had didn't have the same functions.  Right now I'm in my level 3 where I'm exercising to increase my stamina. And when it comes to the function itself, they work great.  The timer and monitor alarm really help me to know whether I already reached the current activity level I desired.  It is very easy to use and to adjust the settings depending on my workout.     Also the design was pretty cool - very sleek and comfortable.

This is a must for anyone serious about getting professional level audio from their DSLR. Let's face it, the audio you get from a DSLR, even one with a 3.5mm input, is pure. Well, let's just say it is horrible. If you get this unit - the price is excellent for what you get and you have two XLR inputs for super clean audio by connecting a mic with XLR input or a wireless mic with XLR input. You also have an outstanding ambient mic on the front for great natural sound. The video cameras I work with all have built in XLR inputs - but DSLR's don't. This is a way to really make your DSLR a video camera too. I use this on a Sony A99 camera and it is great! You can also use this unit away from the camera, if you are shooting something at a distance, you can start recording on the unit by placing it close to the subject area and get great natural sound that way to.

The Cozy Greens Potty Trainer is awesome and so much better than the padded ones you get in the store. I love the quality and the design is perfect for not cracking or sticking to it like the padded ones I have purchased before. We just started to train my 18 month old granddaughter and she loves sitting on the big girl potty but her arms would get tired and she would fall in with this she can sit up there and relax and won't fall in potty she is super excited to have this ring for this step in her young life.  I really like what the Cozy Greens potty ring has to offer:  * Lifetime guarantee * Smooth lines very durable and strong * Grippy safe anti slip ring * Potty training Ebook * Will not break, scratch, or deform like the padded ones that crack * comes with hook to hang for easy access * Donates some profits to charity  The colors are perfect I love the green and white, very durable and strong, packaged nicely for gift giving, fits perfect on the big girl potty to support and help in the potty training process. I highly recommend this potty ring for all those parents who are potty training. We bought padded ones from walmart for my grandsons because of the designs and cuteness and they hated them after a couple uses and wouldn't use they would stick to it and the padding would crack and hurt and little boys would have a hard time with the protector they had to climb over to get one and couldn't stick their private area down cause it was awkward. This is the best Potty Training Ring we have used and will not purchase any other than Cozy Greens. I did recieve for a promotional cost for my honest opinion and all opinions are mine own and we love it so does our granddaughter!!

I would certainly recommend this to those looking to lose weight or those looking to tone their core. Quite simply it works! I can tell you that this ab wheel is a good price compared to those in store models and its good quality, I have had no issues with it despite tons of use.<br /><br />I've been trying to lose weight for six months now and have made pretty good progress. As with any weight loss program it all comes down to eating right, exercising and supplements. Ive never been good at going to the gym so I decided to buy products like this so I can easily workout at my house. So my routine includes pullups, resistance band exercises, pushups and cardio. The cardio helps me to get in shape and burn fat, I usually do some sprints/intervals or some longer distance running. the exercise bands, pushups and pullups help to build muscle and define the muscle. And then the ab wheel helps with my core, keeping a strong core is very important in running as well as just normal day life. I work at a desk so ad exercises help a ton with keeping good posture in a very sedentary job. The ab wheel is NOT easy, I know some people may see it and think they wont get a workout but if you do it right and keep good form you will most certainly feel it. After the first few times using it I was sore for the next day! NOT easy. But if you want results thats what you need.<br /><br />On top of my current workout needs i have also been eating healthy. This healthy eating is mainly towards losing weight so thats the focus of many of my habits. For instance upon waking up I drink a protein shake and eat a banana for breakfast, protein is great in the morning when you are trying to lose weight. 30g within 30 min of waking up is ideal. In total I stick to about 2200 calories a day and try and stay away from processed foods although sometimes it is tough. I also take a supplement called [[ASIN:B00GA200WU Raspberry Ketones ]] which help you lose more weight by burning more fat and raising your metabolism. That combined with the protein shake in the morning help a ton. The protein also has the effect of keeping you fuller longer which helps me make it to lunch time without craving snacks.

This treatment has helped me in so many ways. I have had so much acne, it runs in my family. I've had issues with it in high school, even now I have problems with acne as it is such a genetic thing for my family. I've always hated it. I could never look at myself in the mirror properly because of it. Now, with this it has treated my acne and I've been able to go outside, hang out and do my work without worrying about people judging my acne. Thanks!

When I first use the device it keeps turning off after the lights flashes, the lights didn't stay on or anything. Then, I found it that it does not have a built-in memory and had to get a memory card. So, I bought a 16 gig card and inserted it to the camera and followed the steps indicated on the online manual since the manual that came with the camera was too small for me to read. I was able to record a video and it was pretty clear. Tried saving some files, too, and was able open them on my other computer. Cool gadget.

These super soft cloths are made of microfiber technology are great for any cleaning you have, I use thin the house and my husband uses them in the garage for oily jobs.<br /><br />The best thing is you can clean with or without chemicals because the micro fibres clean so precisely. What I don't like is when you use cleaning cloths and they leave streaks and I love these because they don't leave any streaks and they don't scratch any of your surfaces.<br /><br />They absorb a lot as well, much more than I thought possible. What was surprising is that they can be washed and reused repeatedly, saves you some money on paper towels, if you use them.

Calm and quiet. Our dog hates taking his regular visits to the vet. His persistence in staying at home makes it almost impossible for us to move him as he is a larger dog. We use only a small amount of this and he quietens down short after. The company promotes its 100% natural and there are no side effects from taking this. We only has to visit a couple times over the last few months and its worked every time. Great stuff thanks.

I am giving this DVR 5 stars simply because it does what it is supposed to do reliably.  I have tried almost every DVR that claims to do the same thing.  Let me tell you, the only other one on the market that comes close is the TiVo.  In fact, the TiVo is a better choice If you are looking for more features/bells and whistles and don't mind paying the monthly fee.  I also own a TiVo and to be honest, I like it better primarily because it has Netflix, but I think the DVR+ is a better overall performing unit and would choose it over TiVo and that's why I bought this one because I'm not interest in paying 14 bucks a month to have access to Netflix.  My Roku box does that just fine.<br /><br />I have owned it for several months now and day in and day out it does what it is supposed to do just like I was used to with my old satellite DVR.  The features are on par with most cable or satellite DVR experiences.  If you have ever used one of those this works just the same except for one feature.  This unit lacks the ability to omit repeats in series recordings.  I was told by Channel Master that this was designed this way because if you are not connected to the internet then the box does not receive the information from the broadcaster if it is new or a repeat.  They told me they had a lot of requests for this and looking into adding this capability for those users who are connected to the internet.  The only other thing I would complain about is the remote control.  It is not comfortable In the hand as most cable/satellite remotes because it is thin and the DVR playback buttons are on the bottom of the remote making it a two hand process to jump commercials.  This is not a deal breaker though, you get use to it.  And if you can't get use to it, a universal remote is always an option.<br /><br />If you own an antenna and want a DVR that works like the one you use to have with cable or satellite, the DVR+ is the best bang for the buck.  The other units on the market just don't stack up the same.  Some do not include a remote and require a tablet to control (cumbersome!), others only have a single tuner so you can only record one show at a time, none have an on-screen guide as robust as the DVR+ without paying a fee and last but not least they are not near as simple to use, at least the several different units I have tried.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that I have already had two software updates in the few months that I have owned it. (Yay!  They are making it better).  Plus I have been told that the have a whole slew of internet content coming later this year.(Will see if that pans out)<br /><br />If you want a reliable antenna DVR without monthly fee's, this is the one to buy.  Don't waste your money on others like I did, spend a little extra dough and buy this one.  In the Antenna DVR department, you truly do get what you pay for.

As soon as this arrived I had to try it out.<br /><br />I hated my:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00NGKLBKO<br /><br />I packed it up with my usual travel documents including Passport (which there is a nice spot for in the back half) payment cards, phone card and some foreign currency ( which fits perfectly in the front zippered section). I put it on to see how comfortable it was to wear under my jeans and forgot that I was wearing it until I got ready for bed. The fabric has a nice feel, unlike others I have used before. It would also be the perfect gift to give someone who is a first time traveler. I take groups of students to Europe and always require them to wear a money belt. This one is great as you forget you are wearing it until you need something out of it. I like the fact it has two zippered sections as well. It also has an adjustable strap so it should fit most sizes. The strap feels solid and should hold nicely and not stretch out as the less expensive ones I have used previously do.

I've never liked being on city water, and luckily I had the option of switching so a well system, so I did.

It's a quality built, attractive, comfortable to hold, bright light. The array of tools in the handle, while not for primary use, will serve well when I'm in a bind and need a tool I otherwise would not have. The scissors are especially useful, and screwdrivers and knife are always handy to have around. The seatbelt cutter is quite sharp yet safely shielded, and the glass hammer looks like it would do the job. A hefty point flips out of the side of the handle. Holding the light backward, it feels like a hammer ready to take out a car window.

It takes a while to develop and ear for tuning a guitar, but finally a cheap solution to help you! After buying one of these tuners with a guitar I bought recently, I was pleased to be able to easily tune my own guitar. I then bought one to my 13 year old daughter who is learning to play, and now she can tune her own guitar after her little brothers mess up the tuning. The piece clips onto the end of the neck of the guitar, in between the knobs. All you have to do is pluck a string and the tuner quickly identifies which string and tells you whether the string is sharp or flat or perfect. Great little tuner and very accurate!

My dog used to lose hair at a fast pace and the hair would be scattered all around my place. One of my friend suggested me to use RX4 Pet Shampoo on my dog. Within a month of usage, my dog's hair became soft and shiny. It now looks healthier and my dog looks much more comfortable than before. Also, this shampoo is organic which is the best advantage it has over all other shampoos available in the market. I will definitely purchase more once this bottle gets over.

I got this elliptical as a replacement for a different elliptical I bought here on Amazon and had the worst time with. The first thing I noticed with the first elliptical was how cheap the plastic parts were on it with it costing that much money. I felt as if I paid for something that should have been way higher quality. Also, it would shut off randomly without any notice or true reason. It didn't matter where I plugged it in, it would still do it. Overall, I just wasn't happy and regretted buying it.    If you are thinking about getting this elliptical, please think again -----------------> [...]    I absolutely love the Schwinn 470! It works correctly and feels like it is built with care and built to last. I have owned it for over a month now and can't find a single thing to complain about. Clearly, I should have gotten this one to begin with.    I hope I am able to keep others from making the same mistake I did and just get this elliptical.

I have been searching for a good set of headphones under $100. My first try was with Sony MDRZX600. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B007BY3POQ  I went to Bestbuy set on getting the Sony V55's. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B007BY3PNW Luckily, they head these right next to the V55's. After spending about 15 minutes listening to both, I thought the low's on this one sounded better and the headband had more padding.  They sounded very warm and were great for high's and mids, but the lows were lacking and you needed to listen on full volume for them to sound good. I decided to return them and try the Sennheiser 439 but the volume was too low and that was a deal breaker. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B005N8W1TM  I brought these home http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S749IQ8 plugged them into my Nexus 7 and I couldn't believe how great they sounded. TI listened to Bob Marley Legends album and these head phones sound incredible. The bass is tight and pronounced, but not muddy like the Dr. Drye's I'm very happy with these and I'm very glad my headphone hunt is over.  In summary, Pros: + Great frequency range with deep, rich bass (5 Hz to to 22,000 Hz) + Very comfortable earpads (more comfy than other more expensive headphones I've tried) + Does not make my ears sweat, even in the summer-- a very pleasant surprise + Vibrant color options/ slick design + Wires are tangle resistant (although they are &#34;spaghetti&#34; style for those who care) + Lightweight, and fairly comfortable even with long use + Aesthetically pleasing + Price is decent + Great sound quality for price  Cons: - Plastic build- not cheap feeling but worth a mention - Sound isolation is average, adequate for cafes/ dorm rooms but unsuitable for city/airplane use unless you really crank the volume - Seems to be some some sound leakage at high volumes - Noise reduction, while good for supra-aural headphones, isn't as effective as its circum-aural competitors. This wasn't a big deal to me, but itmay be for some people. - Cord is a bit short (1.2 meters) for some applications (In my case, use with a desktop computer)   All in all I now recommend these to all my friends http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S749IQ8

I was a bit disappointed in how these thermostats had performed in my apartment complex.  My HVAC  tech recommended I try the new Nest thermostat because they had worked out all the kinks that were wrong from the other ones. I was a bit skeptical about using another Nest thermostat, but I trusted my HVAC technician because he always did good work for me. So we switched out the old ones and replaced them with these new ones.<br />What I like most about these thermostat is they are easy to install, and the wi-fi is easy to set up. These have air-wave technology so the compressor shuts down at the appropriate time while the unit is still reaching the desired temperature.  The auto-away technology allows the system to shut off the AC within a specified time frame when the unit senses no one is at home.  All this does is make both me and my tenants happy because they save on utility costs and tend to be more faithful in paying their rent on time with no complications.  For this, I'm convinced this was the best investment I could have ever made for my properties.

I love this compact saw.  It works really well as a travel saw, and I can see  this being used as a survival pack saw if I had to go hiking or camping.  It comes with it's own nice pouch that makes it easy to throw in your camping or hiking bag. It's lightweight and easy to handle.  It does an excellent job of cutting through wood like it's paper.  If you're cutting up a fallen tree, it could be used by two people to shorten the time.  Just keep in mind that the rivets are very fragile and will need oiling prior to the first use and after each use to prevent the blade from rusting and breaking. I am definitely sold on this one.

I love the classy look and feel of the case.  Easy to use.  I don't bother to take off the clip-on part when I'm taking isolated shots, and just slide it easily under the camera while still attached on the two side clips.  Maybe I will take it off if I have to use the camera for a continuous extended period of time.  Currently, the brown version has a mold that does not allow access to the side ports for connecting to a computer.  You have to take the case out if you want access to the ports.  If this is important to you, the black version of this excellent MegaGear case does allow easy access to the ports even as the camera case is installed.  If this feature is important to you, you might want to choose the black version until MegaGear comes out with a similar brown version.    In any case, I'm very happy to have bought this case.  It protects my pricey camera well and makes handling the camera more pleasurable.A nice bonus is the soft black velvet pouch that comes with the leather case.  It protects the case when you put the camera into a bag while travelling.    The case also comes with a leather strap that you can use over your neck or shoulder.  I prefer to have just a hand strap, so I don't use this neck strap or the one that originally came with the Canon.  Instead, I use half a shoe lace tied together to form a hand strap.  Makes the camera easier and less bulky when carrying around.    I'm very happy as well with the wonderful MegaWest customer service when I made queries to them.

This knife feels really solid! I am really happy I came across at this price because I feel it should be listed for more. The spring makes the blade shoot right out unlike other spring “assisted” knifes where your finger has to do most of the work. The digital cammo gives this knife a very masculine look and that's one of the reasons why I bought it. The handle is great and feels very comfortable. This was definitely made to last using high quality parts. I have cut everything from metal wires to rubber and plastic and the blade still works great. Definitely would recommend!

These hoods are so freakin adorable in person! Both the fur on the inside and out are fairly soft and can more than likely be easily hand washed if necessary. There's soft side pockets for your hands (or phone, wallet, etc if needed). There is also a button at top to keep your hood on and a zipper pocket for more storage use. These are super handy if you don't want to wear a small bag to an event or for just staying warm. XD

Have to say that this was one of the best teas I have tasted. The lightness and balance to it was amazing. Later, I learned that this is actually only harvested in a specific region of China for a very limited time (like a few days a year). It has almost a nutty and sweet flavor to it, so it might be a bit different than what you have been used to.<br /><br />This can certainly provide some needed variety from time to time. Of course, the more traditional and full-bodied black teas are probably more mainstream. This version of Earl Grey Grey creme is one of the best I have found anywhere: [[ASIN:B00HFMS74C Organic Black Loose Leaf Tea: Earl Grey Creme 4 oz. + FREE Bamboo Tea Strainer]]<br /><br />This is also a good place to start for those who do not to go in for an overly heavy tea, since it does have some fresh citrus notes before its full flavored finish.

While looking for helpful camping tools for an upcoming girls trip, I came across the Fire Lighter Spider. I bought it on whim but was skeptical since like I said  before, this is not my forte. I tried this on my patio first to make sure even I could make it work, and it is amazing. It is almost impossible not to get a good campfire going with the spider.

I own Roku 3 and Apple TV, Nexus player from Google and the Amazon fire box. For what Im looking for the Q is the only box that does the job the right way without hassles. I have had nothing but problems with the apple Tv from having the jailbreak this thing every month I just gave up on that. XBMC runs flawlessly on the Q and I havent had to do a thing to it. Just run and it works and I mean everything works. All the content I add to XBMC on here plays perfectly. Even the apple TV jailbroken wouldn't play some of my collection. The Nexus is closest but has problems with some MKV formats in XBMC. The Q is by far the most compatible device I have used for throwing any kinda media at and never flinches. It just works. High regards from me for this box and highly recommend for anybody that doesn't want to worry about if their media is going to be compatible or not with the box they own.

Before trying to wear this on your bike/run/jog, fiddle with the instruction manual first; it will save you a lot of time and frustration. Once you figure out the settings and watch capabilities, you will be impressed with it.-It can calculate running speed, distance, work out time, and much more with accuracy.

I purchased mine from Zeldabelle.com so I can't comment on Amazon shipping speed... but if you're Amazon Prime member you know how great it is. However, I wanted to share how much I love this product! I got it for my son's 3rd birthday. He loves it!<br /><br />It was very easy to set up. You could do it by yourself but would be easier for two people - it took me and my friend just a few minutes. All you have to do is assemble and insert the rods into the rod pockets and tie it on top.<br /><br />I know other tents have strong chemical scent but this one doesn't. As I said earlier, I bought it directly from their website and specifically because it is USA made. Maybe I'm little paranoid, but I'm not interested for my son to be a test subject for Chinese toy manufacturers.

I have always used this particular type of feeder for my Hummers. My only complaint is that the bases do not last as long as the bottle and Perky Pet charges almost as much (if you include the shipping charge) as it costs for a whole new feeder. Therefore I am forced to either throw away perfectly good feeder bottles that could still be used or spend as much on the replacement base as I would on a new feeder. I have three bases right now sitting unused under my kitchen sink that could be outside but for the fact that I can not being myself to pay for the replacement base.

How far I know, this Zuhne sinks are manufactured in one of the most advanced manufacturing facilities globally using industrial strength 16 gauge T304 stainless steel from Posco, a world leader in quality steel. I really surprised to know this products contain 25% more steel than the industry standard resulting in sinks do not bow, warp or dent under the weight of heavy cookware. Whether you are draining boiling pasta one moment or flushing ice cold water next. Most interesting, I'm satisfied to use this awesome product, just recommending!!

I am very pleasantly surprised with this bag! It's defiantly a nice bag and holds the stuff I need it to, it not as dark as you can see it in the picture, but that's the nature of leather. The bag is soft and very well put together. This bag was also better than expected on quality. Pleased with the quality and feel for the product especially for the cost. I am really happy with it and would highly recommend this bag!

I had some reservations about using a shock collar, but after talking to an experienced trainer, he recommended one. I learned about why the technology is useful and that it's not damaging to the dog. It's like when you shock yourself after walking across the carpet. I took several descriptions to my trainer and we decide on Hot Spot. It's been very helpful. We were able to adjust the level of static shock and vibration as we went along, which was really helpful.

This travel scale works well.  No more guessing the weight of our suitcases.  We checked the accuracy and it passed.  The scale is sturdy. If you use it as intended, it should last a long time.  You can lift the suitcase and press the hold button so you can look at how much it weighed after you put it down.<br /><br />This scale should last us a long time. It takes a coin cell battery that is easy to replace.  Comes in a box, not a plastic bag.

I  was tired of having my cat wake me up earlier and earlier every morning for food. After reading tons of reviews I decided to bite the bullet and buy this unit even though it is much more expensive then ones you will find at chain pet stores. I've been (or should I say my cat has been) using this feeder now for over a year and it continues to perform reliably as expected. It can be tricky to get the adjustment right for the amount of food (you will have to spend some time adjusting..testing...adjusting) but once you get it set it works pretty well!!!

I live in an area with low quality local water and figured it's time to get a decent drinking water filter system for my family.<br />I browsered for waster filter systems on line for a bit and decided to try this one because it's made in the USA and it comes from direct seller.<br />I installed it myself, you can do it too. The filter system is made with great materials and the water coming out of it is clear and clean.

I have lots of problems with eczema. I have learned that not many skin moisturizers and lotions tend to work on my excessively dry and flaking skin.  I have used Aveeno in the past, but I would really like to  use something a little less expensive than what I've been using. So I tried this coconut oil out to see if it was just going to gloss over and dry out like petroleum jelly and olive oil does. To my amazement, my skin absorbed it and stayed moisturized a lot longer than Aveeno does on my skin.  I use it after every shower and put on a fresh application right before I go outside. I like the idea of using something that costs less. I sold on this oil and will be using it as long as it is available.

I purchased the Infinitec Pocket TV with the Air remote included and I am very happy with my purchase so far. I have been using it to stream films online, use news and social networking apps, play some casual games on the big screen, and have had no problems. None of the stuttering and so on that has been reported for some of the android TV dongles out there. The WiFi works reasonably well and the Air Remote is very user friendly and pairs up well with the dongle.<br /><br />These guys have great customer support (I received a personalized thank you letter from their VP of sales), and ship almost immediately. I first read about Infinitec on Kickstarter, and I picked this dongle over others because it has a recognizable name. People are very active on the Infinitec tech support forum which helps deal with minor issues that one might encounter and how to do cool things with the device.

It is light, well built, and although the plastic seems like it might be slightly more fragile than the Apple equivalents, it is more than sturdy enough and feels quite solid. The screw downs are all recessed (a nice touch) and the connections are all gold plated (at least they look gold plated). The cable length is just right, and the connector itself fits perfectly. The cable itself is heavily molded and doesn't seem as fragile as other similar dongles, so it should stand up to years of abuse. The device is relatively small but obviously the box end is larger than a single DVI or VGA adapter, and measures about twice the length of an Apple DVI dongle and about 70-80% the length of most of my 3rd party dongles. On the other hand, it is thinner than my other dongles which helps in the bag. Considering you'd need three separate adapters, you could be reducing your carry weight by over 4-fold.

this is definitely one of the best games out there, i had bought this for my son and he enjoys it, even I wanna play it sometimes, he owns all the Super Mario games and i think i made the best decision when i bought it. the quality of the graphics is good, we can't complain because you have to be reasonable that the system is from years ago and is still one of the classics so for me it is good.<br /><br />no matter the amount of cables is has around i like it very much and the controllers are simple but not ugly or uncomfortable. i think the mario games are the best because he just doesn't stop playing them.<br /><br />if you have never experienced this console you haven't lived yet. i highly recommend it.

My family had spent hundreds of  $$$ on pest control over the course of one year, when we didn't have babies in the house yet it was okay to use chemicals although it still poses health risks to adults.<br /><br />But we usually schedule fumigation and chemical pest control work around trips. However, it doesn't take that long for insects to return so we had to do it regularly.<br />When my niece was born 4 months ago, we decided not to have chemicals sprayed in our home anymore and we switched to only environmental friendly products.<br /><br />This one is a steal for $16, it's safe and non-toxic and it works so well.

This review is for Wellness WellBites Soft Natural Dog Treats,...  We discovered these Wellness WellBites about a year ago.  The vet put Freddy on a grain free diet and so many treats contain grains.  We had to find something he liked that he could eat.  We bought a bunch of different treats that were grain free.  But the one Freddy seemed to like the best was these WellBites.  The treats are about 1.25&#34; square.  I cut them in to quarters because Freddy is a toy Poodle and doesn't need a whole treat each time.  To him, the quarter is enough good flavor for him to enjoy.  I also cut them into slivers and we play a game where I hide little pieces around the house and he has to sniff them out and find them.  He loves that game.  These treats have enough scent that he can find them fairly easily.  They cut easily with scissors.  The bag lasts a really long time since we only give 1/4 pieces each time.  It lasts at least a month or 5 weeks.  He does get other treats, but he gets at least 2 whole WellBites, cut into pieces, every day.  This is an excellent treat that my dog truly loves.  It's the only treat he has never grown tired of.

I've been using flea and tick spray on my cat for years now since she's extremely sensitive to flea medication. She would foam from the mouth and have mild seizures from time to time. I just couldn't take the chances anymore and was forced to find an alternative.<br /><br />There's a lot of flea and tick sprays and was originally using one that has tea tree, but was told that it's bad for cats because of liver function. So I started looking for something more cat friendly.<br /><br />I've been using using this product for several months and just recently saw that they sell it a lot cheaper on amazon. It does kill insects on contact, but doesn't last more than a day. I would spray her daily before she comes or goes outside to not track anything in. It's more of an immediate insect repellent.

I have had many bluetooth speakers. My husband goes through several a year because he uses them so frequently. So, when we were offered the opportunity to try this Bluetooth Speaker with LCD Display I was excited - but I was not sure that it would be any different from the others we have used.<br /><br />I took the speaker out of the box immediately after receiving it - and I have to say that I was very impressed with its overall look. It's very modern, sleek and sophisticated looking. Plus, the weird waterproof velvety texture is fun and feels nice. I love the bright blue LCD screen - it makes it super easy to see what channel you are on - or which controls you are using.<br /><br />I also loved that unlike so many other devices of this variety - this bluetooth speaker has it's own charger - it does NOT run off of batteries! It has a USB style charger that plugs into the wall or your computer. It charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time. No more having to buy batteries every week. You will get back the cost of this speaker just in the lack of having to buy batteries.<br /><br />The speaker is really simple to use - my phone found it easily - and, after the first time - they are now friends! My phone and the speaker find each other instantly - no lag time. The sound quality is amazing. This is probably one of the larger waterproof shower style speakers that I have owned - and it definitely has a lot of oomph to it. The speaker itself has its own volume and also responds to the media level on your phone. That can take a little getting used to - but it's pretty simple. Overall, I am in love with this speaker. We use it every day - it suctions to a wide variety of surfaces 0 si we can use it all around the house. I really wish it came in more bright, fun colors - but other than that I am super satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely buy this again.

Received this on-time as promised from seller. This little RC is a blast. So far have only flown it indoors, still trying to grasp the subtle control requirements. This is my first RC and I know I'll have to practice (a lot) to be able to control this thing. Still I am having a blast with it. If you have a modicum of patience and get a kick out of technology, I highly recommend this toy. This is not a professional drone, don't expect it to perform like one. If you want a drone, pay the extra thousand bucks (or more) and buy one.

When I came across kinesiology tapes, I felt right away that they might just do the trick.  I wanted to see if they would support my muscles & tendons and also what it would do for my ache & pain areas, especially my lower leg muscles.  I stay very active, but as I am quickly moving into my middle age, my body does not recuperate as quickly as in my younger years.<br /><br />Fortunately for me and my clients, as an experienced personal health/fitness trainer/consultant (path2fit.com), I looked methodically into kinesiology or kinesio tapes to see if it actually worked or was just hype. And as anyone who knows me can tell you, I test something very carefully before recommending it.<br /><br />I compared Kinesiology TAPE + to a few other top brands that are on the market.  My methodology was to put Kinesiology TAPE + on one calf (where I was experiencing over tightness and spasms after workouts) and a competing brand on the other. I then switched the competing brand to another brand after a few days.  What I found is that Kinesiology TAPE + is as stretchy, super-sticky, water/grease proof as it claims.  I actually put it on right after one of my work outs when I was sweaty & oily, as most of us are after a good work out session.  I was surprised that it not only stayed on but it even lasted at least a week through workouts and showers.<br /><br />Instantly, when applied, I did not even feel my injured areas.  That allowed me to continue my exercise routine when I was sure I would have to rest or alter the routine drastically for a few days till I improved.  When it naturally came off, which was a lot longer than I anticipated, it had helped to heal the sensitive area with no allergic reaction on my skin whatsoever.<br /><br />The other brands, even though they had a somewhat similar effect, did not feel as good or last as long as the Kinesiology TAPE +.  And some left sticky, hard-to-remove glue trace after they came off.  Kinesiology TAPE + did not.<br /><br />I do recommend to follow the instructions of cutting the edges in a slightly rounded shape so it will stay on longer.<br /><br />Another thing that I like about Kinesiology TAPE + is that we don't have to be medical professionals to be able to apply & use the Kinesiology TAPE +.  Instructions come in YouTube videos that assist us in applying the Kinesiology TAPE + to the areas in our body that need extra TLC.<br /><br />The almost magical Kinesiology TAPE + has helped me not only keep my exercise routine going but has aided me in healing the inflamed & sore areas in my body including my lower leg muscles.

These wall decals are true to the the picture. They were very easy to apply and although each piece is separate, they are numbered so it allows you to put your own twist on it. I would recommend them for anyone who is looking to add a little forest to the room. We used in the nursery and it matches perfectly with the enchanted forest theme that we picked. We finished the whole wall in about an hour.

I love this thing. I have an older car, and have used this several times to pinpoint and fix the inevitable problems myself, rather than sacrifice money to the auto shop gods. This will also give you some idea what the error codes actually mean, and allows you to clear them. Navigation is also really easy, which isn't always the case with some units that attempt to get by with less than half the buttons of this thing.<br /><br />I've only dipped my toes into the more advanced functions. Honestly there's more capability available than I could really competently use. But it's been nice to have available.

I really like the heavy glass base. I see no possibility of the set tipping over.  There are 3 HDMI ports and one is especially wired for Roku so that you can easily switch from TV to Roku.    I hooked up her Roku LT Streaming Media Player via an HDMI port and quickly set it up. You can get both cheap on amazon here:  [...]  [...]    I did need to change the 'Source' on the included remote to HDMI in order to view the input from the Roku. *No HDMI cables come with the TV, but the High-Speed HDMI Cable linked above Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return work well and are very inexpensive.    Being a 720P LED TV with 60Hz refresh rate, my expectations for the picture were not as high as one with a 1080P resolution. I was pleasantly surprised when I turned it on how sharp the over-the-air picture was using a Mohu Leaf 50 Amplified Indoor Antenna to pick up over air broadcast TV. I picked mine up at the store but amazon again has a good price  [...]    I hooked up the HDTV antenna to the 'Ant In' port on the back of the TV and then ran a 'Air' based channel scan to pick up my local over air broadcast channels. Then saved the channels into the TV's memory. It was super quick and easy to do, and the uncompressed HD channels which are broadcast free over the air are even sharper than cable or satellite channels which use compressed signals. (If you want to know more about how to get over-the-air free TV, check out my book: Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV and if you want to learn how to supplement over air TV with internet TV from Sling TV, check out Simple Guide to Sling TV. )    No, it's not a smart TV with apps, so if you use streaming media and want to view Netflix, you'll need to attach a device to the TV as I did with the Roku box. It doesn't have 1080P resolution, but at only 32", you really won't be able to tell with most high definition programming.    The term 'Roku Ready' is simply a gimmick in my opinion, and considering TCL is one of only two brands putting out the Roku TV, it makes sense they'd be trying to make this non-Roku TV appear just as appealing.    This TV is well made and provides a very nice picture. The included remote is easy to navigate and works well. The HDTV has connectivity ports that allow it to be used as a PC monitor or as a TV (a digital tuner is inside).    All in all I recommend YOU get the:  [...]    I hope this review was helpful!

We had a problem with raccoons in the ceilings of our house. Every night you could hear them above certain rooms scratching and clawing, it got extremely unnerving. We ended up having cracks in the roofing the racoons exploited, but before we could afford to fix it we applied the repellent to the area. We immediately had less of an issue than we had been in the past couple weeks, and I have to attribute it to the repellent. This is a strong product.

I have a fairly high-end home theater system. Unfortunately my living room has hardwood flooring and therefore it is fairly difficult to install speaker wires without creating a fair amount of clutter. I looked at a few wireless speaker kits. I definitely want good quality and thus didn't opt for an entry-level model. However, I didn't want to fork out $500 for such a kit either and thus opted for the Amphony kit which is slightly less than $200.<br /><br />At that price point I was somewhat concerned that the build quality of the kit would not meet my expectations. After receiving and unpacking the kit, I was pleasantly surprised though. While both the transmitter and wireless amplifier units are packaged in a plastic enclosure, they are by no means cheaply built. They have a comfortable feel to them. The two wireless amplifiers are extremely light and quite small. I don't mind that since I have just enough space under my rear speakers to slide them in. I like the fact that unlike other wireless kits you get 2 wireless amps. The only drawback is that you have to set the volume on each amp before using the kit. If you have a fairly modern home theater receiver like I do, however, you just have to set the volume to approximately what you need and let the auto calibration routine of the home theater receiver do the fine tuning. So overall the installation is pretty straightforward.<br /><br />The sound itself is crystal clear - no hissing or crackling whatsoever. I figure that this kit would also be ideal to put some speakers in other rooms of my house but I haven't done any extensive range testing. For what it is worth this kit works extremely well in my living room. Oh, did I mention that even though I have a fair amount of other wireless gear in the house, I haven't had any issues with interference. I guess this is because this kit works at a different frequency. I really like this kit.

The waterproof pouch works great. It's adjustable and fits around the waist. We go to the beach and sometimes I worry a bit (depending on the beach) about leaving my phone, hotel card, id etc on the beach while I wander off looking for shells or take a swim in the water, but I don't want to leave them locked in the car or in the hotel room either. This is the perfect way to keep my little stuff with me while not worrying about it getting wet or sandy, and makes me beach experience even more relaxing and enjoyable.

When I first purchased these headphones I never realized how versatile they would be. Most Bluetooth headsets I own are much smaller and go inside the ears. They aren't as comfortable as these are.  The padding is great for long listening. You won't ever get that uncomfortable or sweaty ears situation.<br />I also appreciate the fact that each time I have gone well over 10 hours without having to recharge them which is a feature that is nice. Lastly I know have been able to use them at night when I am unable to sleep. I can listen to anything on my iPad or MacBook without having to wake my wife up.

It is usually a distressing thing for me to keep searching for an item, unloading and reloading entire luggage only to discover that what we are looking for is hidden somewhere inside one if the bags.<br />But recently a friend told us about these packing cubes. We ordered it and used many of the 4 set pcs during our last trip. It was fun! The relief was unimaginable. We had all our stuff packed in different cubes in such a way that we can easily identify and retrieve them. Even at the airport, the guys did not have to keep running their fingers through our bags as everything was relatively easy for them to check. The trip was a breeze! My kids loved these packing cubes so much. Each three of them had their own packing cubes with their items kept separately.<br />My wife love to pack her make-up in the smallest size, her other intimate items in the smaller ones and then arrange her stuff in order using the remaining ones. The different sizes make packing different items easy. On returning from our trips, we find these packing cubes even more useful. We are able to separate dirty clothes from the clean ones and thus avoid all the disappointments that come with opening your bags in the public.<br />These packing cubes truly make traveling very convenient. It is worth every penny you can spend on it. You cannot put a price on convenience! I will buy more of it and give out to friends. The fact is that many people are not really aware of this type of product and what it can do for them. In a very mobile world, organization is essential. This is where these packing cubes come to play. You can never go wrong with these packing cubes and all theconvenience that come with.

Five Stars<br /><br />I bought this headset weeks ago, it was beyond what I expected for the price I paid and though I do not use them anymore as I am upgrading to one of creatives more premium offerings they still work perfectly no issues with them at all not in four years of use will do fine for games and music as long as you remember the price tag when judging the sound it hits above its weight.

If you have a loud ATV like I do, then you know that you aren't putting speakers on it and playing your favorite tunes.  Also, I have tried using my corded headphones, and I always end up snagging the cord and having to remove the jack to change the music.  So I got this pair of headphones and the sound quality is better than the corded version.  The straps on top of the head really lock the phones on there, and the cushioned ear-pieces hold environmental noise at bay.  Very good product that I recommend buying!

I can't stand any kind of pests but rats and mice are some of the worst. I started using this after using traps alone and annual pest patrol services weren't containing the problem enough. They still manage to get in my garrage in particular and my sons car parked outside would have problems related to mice trifiling through the mechanics. However now I've been spraying this accross my garrage entrance and door which seems to be dettering them quite well, and as this seems to be the main entrance point for them to the house I havent come accross another inside as of yet. My sons also pleased, the mice seem to be staying away from his car now. Nice and easy to use just a spray every few weeks, not bad.

Our 8 month old twins love this toy - and I'm sure it will continue to be a hit as they grow. At this age, they love pulling out the objects from inside the box. Once they get bored of them, I'm sure I can add other toys and household items to the box to keep things interesting. As they grow, we'll likely use the box by playing &#34;guess what's inside&#34; and encourage language development and memory skills. This is a great toy for all ages.

These bags are perfect.  They are just the right size and plenty strong enough.  They've got an adorable little carry case.  I like the fact that they give you a lot of bags so you don't have to buy too often.  A must for pet owners.    I wanted to add one more thing:  These are perfect size also to put a dirty diaper in. We had a yucky one and no trash close by so we put it in the bag and able to dispose of later with no mess!

I wore this pajama as a Party Costume at work and it brought joy to everyone who came upon it! It's warm, comfortable, easy to put on and to clean. My little sister craves for one and she is thinking of buying one too! The only dislike I have is that the cleaning instructions are in Japanese and I was unsure as to how to proceed in washing it. I put it in my washing machine in warm water and let it dry on a hanger just to be on the safe side and the fabric was as soft as when it first arrived. What a relief! But all in all, I love it!

A one of a kind, indie masterpiece. A dark and hypnotic drama that simultaneously explores the ecstasy of new found love and the wrenching pain of loss. Transatlantic teeters on the edge of a fever dream, but never falls off giving it a thrilling undercurrent, even when its pacing is deliberate and almost meditative. All of this while exhibiting an eroticism and honesty about sex that is all but nonexistent in mainstream American cinema. And I would be remiss if I didn't point out the beautiful and hardened lines of New York City serve as the perfect backdrop to the story. Transatlantic Coffee is another reminder that independent film is alive and well and worth finding.Loved every minute, with it's deep script and breathtaking visuals. Can't believe it's FREE on Prime! Rent it, if you like real filmmaking. Don't rent if you want explosions.

Works great!I've been using media player for a number of years and this little Crenova1080P media player just came to my attention the past few weeks because I was looking for a new one to buy for my new apartment. This player is very small, and truly a portable player you would like to carry around on your trip. This little player provides a full spectrum of support almost all video formats in the market place today and up to 1080P HD level. It is extremely easy to setup (it is basically plug and play !). Quality of the play back video is excellent. With this low price, one cannot resist to having this little play in your pocket. Unless one is looking at additional features such as internet access. Since I bought the first one two weeks ago, I've already bought the second one for my travel needs. A great buy for a great price.

Meade is an amazing instructor. I recommend buying this DVD if you are a massage therapy instructor, a beginning student or an experienced therapist who would like to feel confident performing prenatal massage. Meade's approach to pregnancy massage is very gentle and he shows how to position the mother to be in many positions so she will be comfortable during the massage. He shows different massage tables and bolster techniques for prenatal massage and includes detailed massage sequences. The discussion about posture is very informative as well. Lots of useful information that can be only of great use to the future parents. I recommend this DVD. Very beneficial.

I have had this little pedaller for over a year now and wanted to make a second review.  If you haven't already looked at this you should: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWK09Q?tag=i60-20  I originally got this for my mom because she has some heart issues, after years of high blood pressure and diabetes. It will go only as fast as you pedal so she likes how she can take it slow while watching tv, to improve circulation in her legs.  However, if you are a young healthy person looking for a cardio workout in confined space / on the cheap, this is also very effective. Although of course not as effective at burning calories as running outside, if this is what you have to work with, it's doable.  As a note, if you are using this for serious cardio (30+ minutes), I highly suggest buying some ankle weights (3-5 lbs per leg) and wearing them while you pedal - it makes it around twice as hard and is very effective. I bought some weights on amazon with the free shipping option for less than ten dollars.

The WiFi also works, but I choose Ethernet because it was slightly faster. The remote is fully supported, just use it as the box since they use the same remote mappings. I have a VPN with private access network and their android app works with the Box, no issues at all. Highly Recommended.

You can drop a grand on expensive wrought iron or wicker furniture OR you can get something more comfortable and more versatile for a fraction of the cost!<br /><br />You should totally check this out:<br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B0032UY0BU/<br /><br />Using this chair, you can sit up straight, recline partially (which i usually do), or recline to a sleeping position and I find each of these positions to be very comfortable. It does not, however, allow you to lay out flat, such as if you wanted lay on your stomach. You will need a true lawn chair for that. This chair is similar in operation to a recliner but it reclines further and puts your feet higher than most recliners do.<br /><br />Most of you are probably wondering about the length and size of the chair, so I will do my best to give you an idea. I am 6'1&#34;&#34; and 200 lbs. When I lay on the chair with my legs extended, the bottom bar rests under my achilles. However, I rarely sit like that - I usually use the bar as a foot rest and is one of my favorite features. If i do straighten my legs with my achilles on the bar it is not uncomfortable. Without the pillow, the top of my head would rest on the top bar. But since the pillow can be moved up pretty high, I would say it could accommodate someone even a little taller than me. I would not get the wide version because it would be unnecessarily more expensive and would put the armrests farther out. My father-in-law is 5'11&#34;&#34; 270 lbs and is also comfortable in this chair.<br /><br />These chairs fold up tightly and store easily in our garage when not in use. If you grab the right part (turn them sideways and grab the middle bar) it carries easily with one hand.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the grips slipping when the chair partially reclined. I have noticed this too, but only if I'm moving around, like if I lean forward to reach for something. When I'm leaned back into the chair, the chair is centrally balanced and doesn't slipfor me. If I notice that the grips have moved, I just readjust and re-tighten. The grips are right by your hands so this isn't hard to do. Overall, this hasn't been an irritation for me.<br /><br />I am glad I read other peoples comments about rust. Mine are usually under our covered patio, but I would not allow these sit out in the rain uncovered. The outside metal is water treated, but the inside is not, so the inside could collect water, rust, and potentially spill onto your clothes or something else.<br /><br />Have owned them for two years and still love em.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful. If you found this review helpful, please mark yes below.

When I was a little child I used to watch the Donald cartoons every Sunday afternoon. We lived in these years in Poland so it was so difficult to found Donald tales. After we moved to USA and my brother and perhaps also myself watch this cartoon regularly. My favourite character was Dagobert. He was so funny.<br /><br />Some months ago I started to watching Donald films again. It is a great fun! I still enjoy these stories. My childrens (2 boys and 1 girl) also like it.<br /><br />Donald duck for ever!

An excellent portable Bluetooth speaker. Connected immediately to my iPad, iPhone and my husband‘s Samsung Galaxy phone. It comes complete with a USB  connection (to enable you to charge the speaker) .On taking the speaker out of its own box I swiched it on and within seconds a VERY LOUD voice told me that it was Pairing and then the same loud voice told me it was connected. I am amazed at the ease of using this speaker. During the day (the battery lasted all day without my charging it) I had a few calls on my phone. I was able to answer the calls through the speaker. It cuts out the music whilst answering the calls. Also buttons to go forwards and backwards through the songs and also buttons to allow you to adjust the sound. I was able to take the speaker around the whole house with me during the day. The battery lasted 10 hours. I was amazed. It now automatically connects when I switch it on due to the NFC function but I admit when pairing for the first time you need to have the item close to speaker to enable it to pair so easily. We highly recommend this speaker not only because of the ease of using it but for value for money. Any other speaker of the same calibre would cost a lot more. Do not hesitate, it is super.

I didn't think this hose would meet my needs when I first bought it, because it was so lightweight. I thought to myself “how can something so lightweight be durable enough to last”.

It doesn't kink, stores well, and is easy to use. This hose is perfect for my needs!!

Walking my pit bull has never been an easy work. Every leash I have ever purchased has either broken or I was not able to control my dog with them. I was ecstatic when I came across the hands free dog leash from Quality Choices and knew I had to give it a try at such a great price. I have dropped and broken my phone from my dog dragging me while walking. Starr was confused and stayed by my side when I wrapped the belt around me and we took off for a fast walk. After a few minutes she was back in front, big ears flopping in the wind. With this hand free leash I have more control using my body and now it feels like my dog and I are having a real connection while walking. If that is not enough for anyone the free LED light that connects to the leash for night walking is enough to purchase. Dogs like mine that are scared of the dark and taking her outside at night is a huge trouble. The LED light helps my dog with better vision at night time!

I have been using this for the past few weeks and I have noticed a difference in my workout to be honest ever since I was using this. Its very comfortable and one size definitely does fit all. It's very portable indeed I can carry it around like a small suitcase and I can basically take it everywhere. It really does help prevent injuries and that's my number one concern in workout products! I recommend you get this product if you really want an experience with your ab mats!

Just received my watch case. It came double boxed and was really well packaged. The inner box had foam on top of the glass and the whole thing was also covered in a plastic wrap. Much better than what you usually see.<br /><br />Since the case was relatively cheap, I expected the usual low quality manufacturing. I was pleasantly surprised. The glass top is really glass, and the whole thing looks quite attractive. The top opens easily, the inserts are nice and sturdy.<br /><br />I was even happier when I saw that my larger Casio watches had room in the compartments. Usually they are too tight to fit well. I managed to fit my whole Casio collection in this case. The solar models are in the center so that they can still catch some light while protected in the box.<br /><br />I highly recommend this case, probably the best one in this price range. I would buy another if I needed more room for watches.

I love buying my tea in bulk when I can. It is a great way to save money. With this version of the silver needles variety it makes it easy to have a nice and light cup of tea anytime you want. It is very easy to brew and this brand also allows you the ability to get several brews or steepings out of each of the leaves. That helps to make it very economical.<br /><br />For those times when I feel like splurging a bit, I tend to go with something like this: [[ASIN:B00HFMS74C Organic Black Loose Leaf Tea: Earl Grey Creme 4 oz. + FREE Bamboo Tea Strainer]]<br /><br />Earl Grey creme has a strong and refreshing full-bodied flavor. You can even tell this just from the smell. Many people consider it to be a perfect breakfast tea. While I don't disagree, it is also great in the evening. Like I said, this is a variety that can really give your normal tea routine a little change-up.

Fits perfectly with my http://www.amzn.gift/dp/B006Z2BZBU/  I was unsure about buying these because we've tried other brands of crib sheets that do not fit DD's mattress, even though its a standard size. I decided to try them because the price was low enough to where I wouldn't be upset if they ended up not fitting after all. Luckily these do fit perfectly even after washing and drying several times. We had some thicker flannel ones but I wanted to get some lighter cotton ones for the warmer months and to take to daycare for DD's cot, and these are perfect. They are very soft and lightweight. I purchased the mint and the pink geometic dots. I will definitely be purchasing more in the near future!  ---------  After using these sheets for several months now I've decided to come back and review again.  These sheets are great! I change my daughter's sheets two or three times a week on average, and I only have 5 sheets that fit her bed, so they get washed A LOT. In all those washings the colors on these have not faded, there are no holes, and the elastic is still working great.   The same cannot be said of the other brands of sheets we have tried which we have purchased from both Babies R Us and Target. I will definitely be buying more!  I hope this review was helpful!

I instantly informed my colleague, who was in charge of the gate security, so that he caught the thief successfully and returned the purse. The woman was so grateful that she wanted to buy us a meal. Maybe for security sake, setting up an ip camera in the elevator is really a good idea.

Amazing!!!! the juices were at my door step the next morning just in time for breakfast!<br />It came in an adorable cooler bag that was a perfect size to carry around throughout my day.<br />The drinks stayed nice and cold inside the bag.<br />My favorite has got to be the SWEET SPIN its delicious, nutritious, and filling. It was great for a morning booster.<br />I have tried other juice companies and with out a doubt Jus by Julie comes out right on top.<br />Each Jus was refreshing and delicious. By the end of the day I was already feeling great!<br />Chia Berry was great for a mid day snack. Island Coconut is also one of my favorites!<br /><br />Usually you can't use healthy and delicious in the same sentence, but not any more!! thanks to JUS by Julie!!!<br /><br />GO JUS BY JULIE!!!

My remote control car is pretty cool. My favorite part about this car is it doesn't require any weird battery charging apparatus, like some others. It takes regular double AA batteries for both the controller and the car. I look forward to racing my car with my son. This will be great for our bonding time. When I was a kid, my cousins and  I would play  cops and robbers with no toys. Nowadays kids can have toys to add to the action. This particular car comes with lights and sound to add to the fun time. I know this brand makes other types of cars. I will have to see what they have that will be fitting for "robbers” car.

My hubby and I like drinking coffee...a lot!  However, neither of us like a particularly strong cup of coffee.  This particular coffee bean is a nice brown colour and not too oily - much like the coffee beans that you see being used for coffee making in Italy.  It does make quite a strong espresso and, if you like it strong, this will be perfect for you.  We tend to prefer our espresso to be more of a medium roast, so we ended up using these coffee beans to make espresso to use as a base for lattes.  For us, this was perfect!<br />To be fair, it is all down to taste - some people like their coffee stronger than others.  If you like a good quality strong espresso, then this is for you.  Although, if you like your coffee a little milder (cappucinos and lattes), then this also does the job nicely.<br />We will definitely be back for more!

Since their stretchy, I would extend those around half percent for cozy wrap for them not to slip, including top the adhesiveness ensures.

I was inspired to go out and buy this bar by research released by Harvard this past march about the health benefits of flavanoids in cocoa. I just went out and picked up the bar with the highest cocoa content assuming I'd be getting a the highest dose of flavanols (the class of flavanoid that is found in cocoa)... after a little more research though, I realized I'd picked the wrong brand for that. Looking at the ingredients, you'll see that the cocoa is &#34;processed with alkali&#34; (aka Dutch processed chocolate). Apparently, 60-90% of flavanoids are removed during Dutch processing (according to wikipedia). From what I read, you're much better off trying trying to find &#34;natural&#34; chocolate if you are going for the health benefits.  On the other hand... I'm totally addicted to this chocolate! At first I found it too bitter and ate it along with some grapes to help sweeten it up, but after a few nights my palate has changed and am loving it just the way it is. Too bad about the Dutch processing.  If you are going for the healthiest brand regardless of price, it looks like the Xocai brand is the way to go. Not only is it natural, but it's cold pressed (heating the chocolate also removes flavinoids) and is sweetened with açai berries. I couldn't find any data on how big of a difference in flavanoid content of cold pressed and non-cold pressed chocolate, but I doubt it's worth the current cost.  There's a few good dark chocolates available here at amazon that are natural and dairy free with high cocoa content including: Dragoba makes an 87% cocoa organic chocolate bar, and Endangered Species makes one at 88% (Black Panther Extreme Dark Chocolate). Stay away from bars that don't post their ingredients on Amazon (such as Green & Black's organic 85% cocoa dark chocolate bar which contains whole milk).  If you love chocolate half as much as me, you should really look into getting   http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00FPGLMLA

I love the Blasta Boombox, it’s by far the best portable speaker I've bought in recent years. I didn't believe it was really waterproof until I used it in my shower, it worked perfectly! I can be playing music upstairs and go downstairs and still hear the music. Plus, it works great with my old third generation iPod. I love the the bass too, usually when I get a speaker there’s not enough bass but this has the perfect sound. And  the weight of it is so light I never have a problem moving it to several places in my house. Another cool thing about the boom box is that the battery reasonably long! I barely have to charge it. Overall, I love this product and would recommend to anyone that loves music.

The TaoTronics TT-CL001 LED Lantern is an awesome LED Lantern for emergencies and camping environments.<br /><br />- 2 handles that flips up/down<br />-LED at the lantern window that can be compressed down to be protected and carried<br />- Runs on 3 AA batteries (not included)<br />- Sleek plastic finish that looks metal in appearance<br />- Very light material<br />- Adequately sealed exterior design to resist splashes<br /><br />When it comes to LEDs, these will last a long time with the AA batteries compared to the old school flash lights which are dim.<br /><br />The lantern itself does provide a cross shaped shadow around the base, due to it's design.<br /><br />Usage is easy, simply lift up and it will trigger the lamp to light up.<br />No need to fumble for the power switch in the dark or try to light that match in darkness as well.<br /><br />Top lid is removable to access two wires that most likely powers the LED.<br /><br />Base can be opened to replace/install batteries.<br /><br />Overall, a sturdy lantern with a nice build that fits the camping fun. Easy to use and compact.

I had read the first two books several years ago and naturally had imagined all the scenes and characters. HBO has done a fantastic job at narrating such a complex story in a rather intricate way yet still keep a great flow to the narration. Kept my attention through the entire Season 1. Can't wait to watch Season 2. This is one of the few books where the movie/TV series has not disappointed those that have read the book.

I am starting a small business and need a toner that prints professionally. I don't have a lot of money to work with in this start-up, so I purchase off-brand cartridges. Like most people, I have had several cartridges that - out of the box - they printed with streaks or didn't work at all. To replace them with the company would not be cost effective. So I read reviews carefully. I purchased these toner cartridges because of the life-time guarantee and I noticed the company monitors the feedback on Amazon. The printing is great; however, you can get that with most of the cartridges. What is important to me is if I get a dud, the company will replace it whether I use it now or a year from now. You can't buy that level of service.

I am using this product for four months now and I can say I am very satisfied with the quality of this product. The installation was straightforward. I had to drill 1/2 hole through my cabinet side to connect the hot water hose. The installation took about 15 minutes. The supplied fittings were handy and the hose was more than enough to connect the cold and hot water. I did not have any leaks after installations. My kids loved the bidet so much that they started using the master bath (I bought one initially to test the bidet). Now I am going to buy 2 more for the other bathrooms.

I am impressed with not only the price, but the quality of this battery is great. I did not know that I have been overspending until a friend told me that there are other brand batteries for my collar and I should look into saving some money. I am sure glad I did. I do have high hopes that it will last as long as the others on here but even if it doesn't last just as long I will still be happy with it since I will still be saving a lot of money in the long run.

This strolling stick was awesome! Simple to fall and an enormous help as I strolled all over Scotland. I was truly glad to have it! No issue in the airplane terminal at all! AS promoted, these strolling sticks agreeably fit into a knapsack or carry-on, are lightweight, collect effectively, and don't slip once their tallness is situated. They held up well on the stone steps and earth ways of the Amalfi Coast and Capri on a late outing. Whether that keeps on being valid over the whole deal stays to be seen, yet I was totally fulfilled by them. It is elusive strolling sticks that overlap this little (14&#34;) at any value or to discover less collapsible sticks at this cost ($50 for two, with material conveying cases included). I'm exceptionally inspired with these. I have been taking a gander at different collapsible poles now for around 18 months, and constantly figured I'd make good and purchase an arrangement of Black Diamonds.

This is by far the best color wired intercom I have installed.<br /><br />I have now installed two of these, the first one for my wife and I where we have two kids and want to know who is at our door before we let them in. This was very easy to set up and the picture on the monitor very life and natural good colors. Quality of this product is above my expectations. The price is a winner!!!<br /><br />The other was for a close friend of ours who is alone much of the time.<br /><br />Both were faultless installations as the instructions and quality is excellent. The only problem I encountered was that the distance from where the camera to the video screen on both installs were much further than the cable provided, so I adjusted myself by soldering an extra length.<br /><br />Overall a good buy!

They were fine until yesterday 5/15/15. Then they became GREAT! I accidentally washed them with a load of clothes at the laundromat in one of the big industrial washers. By the time that I realized they were in the machine instead of with my tablet and keys, it was too late to do anything. I resigned myself to buying a new pair and chalked it up to just one more thing that went horribly wrong for me this Mother's Day . But, when I took the clothes out, something said to test them. When I did, they were still working ! And then this morning when I plugged them up at work, still working! So I highly recommend these.

When I saw the advertisement for this pillow on television, my curiosity was piqued.  I did some research and found this first, but this was a better deal: http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0045UF6E6/  I have been wanting a new pillow for quite a while as I have been waking up with a sore neck and back in the mornings. I decided to give this one a try.  After the first night, I was not impressed. It seemed awkward and each time I shifted during the night, I had to think about how I was supposed to position my head. I decided that one night was probably not sufficient test time for this pillow. I have slept on it 5 nights now and I really like it. The support for my back is great and just what I was looking for. The way that it wraps around my head makes me feel cozy and supported. I would recommend this pillow for any side sleepers out there looking for a different, more supportive pillow.

The acting is without a doubt one of the reasons to see this film. I was surprised to see Fox in a role like this, granted she didn't have too much to do but look and act wounded. She definitely pulls it off and shows that she just may have more range than people give her credit for. Rourke was shockingly mellow in this drama, usually he plays some sort of bad guy, but here he's more of a doormat. The real reason to watch is Murray -- he's not in it as much and he certainly knows how to play a wise-cracking, smart-guy gangster. I, personally, would have loved to see more interactions with Murray and his associates to see how he handled some other situations.

Visually inspected the struts. All four struts appears to be well made. Very solid and heavy feel to them. Also, compress the struts by just to see how it feels and they were good. The rear strut were exact fit. However, during the initial test drive there were some initial rattle and clunking sound coming from the trunk. Further inspection showed that the rear upper mount bushing had some wear and was not able to tighten the strut nut all the way - some play left. So, more washers were added so the nut could e tighten all the way and no more play. Push the car up and down to see this. You should see some play if there issue.

As good as advertised if not better. The shirt stays don't come undone no matter what you do. No damage at all to shirts. Really impressed with how these are constructed from all aspects. Very good metal but not too heavy so they are comfy and light. You can tell when you squeeze them how strong they are and that they're going to hold up without breaking. The nylon covers on the insides keep hold of the shirt and don't leave marks. The elastic is soft and doesn't yank on my leg hair. That's a problem I thought I'd always have with shirt stays, but these ones don't do it at all. Big improvement over what I was using before. Even easy to get on despite how hard they grip. Whoever designed these did a really good job. They thought of everything.

I am going to cry when this poor thing finally gives up the ghost. Not that it will do it any time soon though. It is a rugged bag.<br /><br />I put way too much stuff in it and still it looks good. It has compartments for everything.<br /><br />The double straps makes it comfortable to carry over your shoulder or in your hand. It makes a difference having this option. It makes the bag useable in all situations.<br /><br />I could not ask for a better bag.

I bought this because I work in and around water a lot and I needed something to protect the lenses on my (expensive) sunglasses when I was not wearing them. They attach to the arms of the glasses via a tube of neoprene and although they are really easy to put on they actually stay put really well. They have a handy clip on the side to take off and put back on quickly which saves the fiddling with the sunglasses arms every time.<br /><br />Anyway, once on they are pretty comfortable and to be honest hardly noticeable. The most important thing is that they float if they fall off into water and can easily be seen from a long way off. Anyway, really pleased with mine.

I was hesitant to buy these because I was under the wrong impression that I needed cleats or studs to get good traction. But these funny little nubs work GREAT! I used them to walk back and forth from my truck to the ski lodge on ice and I could run & stop on a dime. I can't comment about using them for hiking, but if you're looking for keep from falling in your driveway, sidewalks, or wherever you may go throughout your day- these work very well!

I have to say it is a very useful light.<br /><br />Firstly, it is 12 LED inside and the light and very pure white light, good to reading at night.<br />Secondly, it can fold completely and it is very useful for taking it out. You must take it to camping.<br />Third, 270 degree rotation is very funny and convenience. I cannot stop to turn it.<br />And the lightness can turn by touching the switch which is very impressed.<br />It is built-in 600mAH battery and last 7 hours with full charge. Usually I use it before sleeping so I only charge it about once a week.<br /><br />It looks so good when it stand on my desk. Love it so much.

I have fallen in love with this entertainment system!  I'd been looking for a system like this for a while.  This is a great blend, vintage look, new age feel.  The cabinets built with complete care and of the finest materials, this should last for a long, long time.  The turntables simply amazing!!!!  I show everyone who comes by my new stereo, you have to see this for yourself to completely understand how great this Ttable is. I would buy this again, HANDS DOWN the best on the market!

My wife saw these water stations being used  at the Irvine Pet Adoption Event in 2007, the year we adopted Sadie, our 3rd Lab rescue. They were set out around the venue to water the guests.  I thought they were a little pricey for a 5 gallon bucket but we were tired of those cheap 5 gallon Pet mate plastic jugs that kept breaking. And they are not that cheap once you break 5 or 6 of them. How can you clean the algae out of those things anyway?  But I digress, so If I was at work, my wife could barely lift that 5 gallon jug , invert it and plant it squarely into the base without breaking the jug or spilling water everywhere. So I bought a Critter Cooler and now I have two, one for inside one for outside, our daughter has a 3.5 gallon, our neighbor has one and we bought another 6.5 gallon and donated it to our local animal shelter. These things are awesome.. I love the little yellow plug so we can drain the bowl and clean the drool and gunk without wasting the water in the tank.. The wheels are high quality, at the Home Depot they would cost about $7 each. And when we got our daughter her Critter Cooler, it was missing a valve, so we called the company and the owner, James, called us back and apologized, sent the part priority mail that day and included a bottle of his dog shampoo. So great product and service and my wife was right again.

Well ain't this a life saver &#60;3. It's compact and will fit easily in your home. Cools down the room pretty fast and well just like AC! Being student, I was looking for cooler which is not as costly as AC but could cool the room like it. This really does that. It doesn't cost that much of power either as I could see from my monthly bill. I never had any problem with it either during my so far tenure with it.

We have 4 dogs from all sizes and we do not want people to know this when they walk up in our yard, deck etc. This is amazing, it takes away all pet odor from outside.

I totally recommend http://fave.co/1c3G1er  They look real from a distance, but I think when you're really close to them, they look basic. We hung our high. The stickers you get here are a nice touch.  http://fave.co/1bL2PyO  The only thing I would add to these is a battery for a red LED light. I had a camera as a kid that had 2 AA batteries that actually moved when it sensed motion... battery lasted over a year. I also recommend drilling a hole in the base of the mount, to feed the fake cord through on these, to make it look like the cord is being wired into the house. The fake cord as packaged (at least in mine) was just hanging off the camera.  My mom lives in a pretty small neighboorhood, though it is close to a few highschools. Every year when school gets out it seems like the neighborhoods around there get small break-ins, nothing major. Her house had her window broken into, stole small amount of money and that's it. I purchased these for her to place around the outside of her house, and the back garage.  She got this one first   http://fave.co/1bL2ufF  I got a set of these a few months ago and they are great. I came back to order more but they have changed the design! The older ones were actual casings from real cameras. This new design looks incredibly fake and too &#34;plasticky&#34;. Also, how many real cameras have the cheesy flashing red light? Almost none. If you do buy these, at least don't put in batteries for the light to flash...that's a dead giveaway that they are fake cameras. Unfortunately I will have to find another brand that isn't so obviously fake.  Side note...a little trick I like to do is to label my FOUR cameras 1, 4, 7, 9 etc...if someone is sniffing around and they can only find four, they will expect that the others have to be somewhere that they can't find.

OK, so I've already  gone through 2 pop filters that I've previously purchased here on Amazon. They were pretty cheap and I figured it's all the same. NOPE! They broke apart and were flimsy it was ridiculous. I wasted my time and money with these things.<br />Enter the new guy (gv-pro 1) and I was pretty pessimistic but right out of the box (it's a pretty neat looking package) it already had a much more solid build and sturdy hold on my stand. I'm very happy with how it looks and holds up. Also, my recordings are crystal clear and I barely have to do any editing to clean up the audio!

Found this unique monopod with built in battery charging for the Hero 4. Besides the great use of the monopod, I've to admit that it's inconvenient to replace my battery of my Hero 4 especially with the housing unit on it. This battery monopod allows my Hero 4 to shoot continuously without taking my Hero 4 out of the housing and replacing the battery. The large battery capacity definitely beats replacing standard batteries every time I run low on battery. Highly recommended.

I love this product!  What a great idea!  I am a grandma now, but I made my own baby food when my sons were little using ice cube trays.  This is vastly superior.  The tray is stable from table to freezer.  The lid, though challenging at first, is actually easy to close once you get the hang of it.  Food pops easily out one at a time and the amount is very comparable to a baby food jar.  Love the recipes!  I'm keeping mine for when grandchildren visit, ice cubes, a multitude of usable situations, and I'm going to buy more for practical Baby Shower gifts!

Smaller can be better, especially when you are talking about a device that is intended to be on the compact side of things. This iPad dock is small enough to easily move it about, either in the house or taken in a bag on the road. The included remote control means no more having to stand up to change volume or pause. The dock even has audio outputs so that it can become a part of an audio system while watching movies or video.<br /><br />As a charging port it's factory grade and doesn't overcharge. Use it while charging. The base is stable for being as small as it is. This dock is simply operated and fills my need.

I have 3 dogs, enough said. All of them are technically short hair but one is a retriever mix so there is a golden glow to the house. Having used brushes in the past, I thought I just had to live with this. When I received the Hair Hero I was impressed by its design-- it felt so good in my hand. I started right in on the retriever and wow! I could not believe the pile of fur it produced. Thunder looked like a different dog and he was dancing around, coming back for more. (???) Seeing this, the other 2 lined up for their turn. I wasn't expecting much from their coats, but again, a surprising amount of fur. Another surprise, they were so shiny. So, needless to say I am totally sold on this product.

Why didn't I buy one of these sooner?! It saves SO much time. I've run into a couple wires where it doesn't catch on the first try, it just strips it a little but.

I installed the inverter in my RV. There is decent space there for ventilation - but no more than 6 inches on each side and a few feet on the back. This inverter can handle many things at once. It run almost all my gadgets at same time. 1100 watts are good enough to play DVD player and a TV using a 10 foot extension cord and it works great, I can also charge my cell phone and other devices simultaneously. Great product great price. I ordered the extra cables that are needed to run the unit any distance to the battery by the way. The small clamps that came with it will not cut it for installation at any distance away from the battery.

Works quite well, bought 2 and both are good. didn't know I can't listen on 2 headsets on Bluetooth at once (not the suppliers issue, it's the Bluetooth protocol).

The earbud on the side w/ the receiver/ switch keeps falling out due to the weight but I have not tried the different ear plugs supplied. Volume switch could be more prominent from the body of the control, hard to find by feel.

These provide excellent for lighting outside deck stairs. During the summer months they will remain lit all night. Note, in standby mode they shine a nice dim light. When motion is detected, they go to high power as long as movement is detected, or approximately 30 seconds. During winter months, they will operate for several hours, but run out of power before dawn; this isn't an issue for me. They do need several hours of direct sunlight in order to recharge the batteries.

We HIGHLY recommend looking, and even getting http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00NFETB9Y  We had a wind up mobile before purchasing this one and hated it. THIS one http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B005F21DA4  This mobile is wonderful. I think the baby especially likes the projection. The first time we turned it on, our 2 month old smiled and smiled. The remote control is handy and I love that it plays for 20 minutes.   I don't know how long the batteries will last, but it is so much better than the wind up kind I don't care. It was easy to install on the crib and is very secure. I wish there were more volume settings (it has two). Even on the loudest setting it is kinda quiet. I would definitely purchase this mobile again or buy it for other future mothers for a shower gift.  We just put batteries in it last night, and I am in love with it!! So here it is from baby's eye view. :)  The only downside: the tiny screwdrivers that are needed for assembly. I had to search through my husbands computer kit to find one that was small enough.

If it did not work well, I have no other choice but return. However, my son loved it. He always do the assembly for those things, so it was quite a easy thing for him to put this kit on his hexacopter. The parts were not flimsy, but quite solid. It had strong legs. The mounts are made by alumimum. That was a reason I chose this, because it really looked better than those made by cheap plastic.And its color sexied up the quad's looks, was pretty as the descritiopns.

We do have to have it tighter than his normal collar to reach his skin but he listens to the beep or the vibrate settings.

I'm surprised when I bought this one as its size is smaller than the other Quadcopters I have at home.<br /><br />At first I find it difficult to control because it has more sensitivity than other quadcopters I've used so far, but eventually after using it for 3 times, I managed to adjust myself on it. And I find it amazing, as it was my first time controlling a copter than can do a 360 trick.<br /><br />About the battery, so the lifetime is your average one where the charging time is longer than the playing time, but even so, I really liked this quadcopter so I decided to bought another 3 sets of battery so I can play it longer. Also when it comes to price, it was really cheap than your typical RCs and it was also ready to fly from the box where I find annoying in other brands where it took me few minutes or hours to set up the RC.

Colin Quinn was really dry and offbeat on Saturday Night Live and I hadn't seen any of his standup until this. It's an amazing performance piece, with the history of mankind broken down into a series of vignettes that use modern behavior to explain how we developed over thousands of years. Essentially riffing on how absurd our behavior is when we're combative and tribal, Quinn somehow manages to hold the thing together throughout, and there's a good laugh about every 25 seconds, which by any show's standards is good. I'd put this up there with Will Ferrell's George Bush one-man show, but add that in doing it as a simple monologue with a backdrop of slides about the places and nations he's discussing, Quinn pulls off a more difficult routine just as well.

I used them mostly on semi-precious stones and some seaglass. The bits worked quick and well. Much better than the twisted ones.  If you have a press, it would be the ideal way to drill. But hand drilling will also work. You have to be drilling under water. Otherwise, bits won't last long.<br /><br />Drilling such tiny holes in any kind of material is not an easy thing to do.

I checked to make sure and this had no issue at all, and the quality of the plastic was superb!<br /><br />Getting through with the unboxing and the checkup, me and the boys first tried to make the model on our own, with no success, I downloaded their video guide. I was no hard to find as they had it on their website. The video explain a few thing we were doing wrong and voila. the t-rex was up and lit at its best! I was honestly very impressed with this laser pegs. It was a great fun to put it together with the boys. Now both of them play with it together, and make the rest of the 23 dinosaur models on their own!

They say that PG Tips black tea is the number one brand in Britain. One taste will certainly show you why.  This is rich and full of flavor. I think that even if you are not really a big tea drinker this would be the perfect brand to try. This totally blows away anything that you are likely to find here in the supermarket. You will also appreciate the fact that the flavor and consistency produced by this brand is one of the better that you will find. It is very nice for drinking every day.<br /><br />Of course, there are also those times when you want to add a little bit of variety to things. In that case, might I suggest taking a look at this item: [[ASIN:B00HC582FQ Organic Black Teas Loose Tea Trio Sampler - Earl Grey Crème, Sweet Almond Wild Berry, Sweet Hot Cinnamon (2 Oz) + Free Stevia (5 Grams)]]<br /><br />This one gives you some interesting black tea choices. Although I had heard about Earl Grey tea from watching Captain Picard in Star Trek: TNG, actually trying this was quite amazing. For those times when I want something a bit spicy, I really go in for the sweet hot cinnamon. The other option is tea that combines almonds with a fruit flavor finish--you will end up loving this! Try these today.

I believe this is the same product as the  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B003AKF4EE  I decided to replace the rollers after one of my garage springs broke. The original rollers were nylon but did not have any bearings. The repair technician showed me the easiest way to replace them. Take a vise grip plier and bend out the metal side track about 2 inches after the curve from vertical to horizontal.  Which is sold by Sanford and Son Overhead Doors too. The only difference is that these are sealed bearings.  For the bottom roller, bend out a section of track 6 inches before the bend from vertical to horizontal. Align the bottom roller to the open section of the track pop out the roller and replace it. Bend back the track.  Align one of the rollers and use a large screwdriver between the track and side of the roller to pop the roller out of the track. Of course you will have to hold up the section of the garage door. Replace the old roller and pop in the new roller into the track. Repeat for the rest of the rollers except for the bottom roller. Use the plier and bend back the track.  This will be the easiest way rather than pulling out the side rails or removing the hinges.

My husband needed to replace his old wallet (it was falling apart!) and wanted something a little different than the traditional tri-fold wallets he usually bought. This wallet is exactly what he was looking for. It has just enough space for his various cards, his cash (you have to fold it), and a few other little things. This wallet is rigid, which he loves, and he feels pretty certain that his wallet items will be well protected.<br /><br />I'm not sure how the RFID protection works, but it's a feature that he wasn't concerned with. He just wanted a new wallet, and we found this little beaut. I'm sure the RFID protection is handy, and if it's ever needed that his cards will be safe and sound.

LOOK!!! If your looking for the real thing than BUY IT!!!  This is an ELECTRIC drum kit and with regards to anyone who thinks this will replace their "REAL" kit, i hate to break it to ya but nothing sounds as good as the real thing no matter how much money you spend.  If you want a practice set for jammin out and having fun doing it this is probably a good choice.  I play guitar a little and wanted to try my hand at the drums. I looked at a used set of drums costing 450 at Guitar Center; this was better as it was new and cost less.   As a starter set the kit is perfectly fine and works they way it should.  Although i wouldn't call this a replacement kit, I would recommend it.

We have 3 cats and a dog, which makes for a pretty high probability of *something* happening to our carpets occasionally.

If you're looking for a gift for a child that's just the right combination of fun, excitement, and an excellent learning experience, you've found it.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product enough. I bought it for my five year-old niece and it quickly became an adventure for her and the entire family.<br /><br />The caterpillars were delivered promptly. All five were alive and soon began eating themselves silly. The chrysalides formed in a matter of hours after just a couple days of eating. A few days later, they hatched overnight into gorgeous Pink Ladies.<br /><br />What a wonderful way to teach children (and adults!) about the miracle and fragility of life.<br /><br />The house itself is durable and well-made and the educational materials that accompany it are clear and informative.<br /><br />One tip if you do buy this item: Keep an eye on them. They grow up so fast! Taking pictures of their different stages might be good for a elementary school science project, too.

I always like to order my water with lemon in restaurants, lime or a slice of orange. At home I also do the same thing - just squeeze a wedge of lemon or lime and drop it in the glass. Sometimes it is just so hard to try and drink the recommendation amount of daily water when you are drinking it &#34;straight up&#34;. Now with the Fruit Infused Water Bottle by Acquablend I am able to load up infuser tube with lots of fruits and just refill the bottle and enjoy flavored water all day long.  I really like that this bottle is transparent and you can see what is inside. It has a wide mouth instead of a spout. As you drink you can smell the delicious aroma of the fruits from the infused chamber. The caps also seals to a leak proof seal. 100 percent BPA-free and dishwasher safe.  Fill it with anything you want. My favorites are grapefruit, lemons, limes, strawberries, oranges, raspberries and passion fruit seeds (crushed a little bit). You can really make you imagination go wild with this bottle. Your only limits are the fruits you have in the house. Overall its a great product and I am very happy with this purchase !!

But that's fine, I can just mute the projector speakers by pressing the &#34;mute&#34; botton on the remote control and use my surround sound systems.<br /><br />In summary, worth buying for this price range!

Also he creates some of his own using his imagination, so now me and my son are constantly building new things. He just doesn’t seem to get tired of it.

First off, if you ever (and it's rare that you have to) need to call their customer service, they are informative and friendly and second off, Epson just plain builds great products.

I read through all the reviews prior to picking up this knife, as I wanted to ensure I was getting the most out of my moneys worth, as well as being an avid outdoorsmen, who greatly appreciates his/her primary tool. Fortunately for me, upon my knife’s arrival, there was little for me to critique or complain about, as all the con’s that were covered from other reviewers seemed non-existent. Upon opening, the blade came very sharp, straight, much larger than expected, with the scabbarb (sheath) perfectly intact. There is plenty of reach (I’d like to reiterate "PLENTY”) with 13” overall length and a great piercing ability from everything that I have dealt with outdoors thus far. The Pakkawood handle provides great comfort, and feels very well balanced between the blade and the entire knife.<br /><br />Overall, a very well made product and I would recommend this knife to any outdoors or even indoor individual! I will definitely be looking into other Elk Ridge products, as this has been a great buy, for such a LARGE Blade! Take advantage of this product while stocks last!!

Whilst crime is not rife in my area we do have trouble with youths who hog the darkened areas of the street at night. I needed a good, bright light that would light my porch area if anyone came to close to my front door.<br />This light is ideal and with a whopping 850 lumen output it is damn bright! One ideal thing is that it is completely self-contained and does not need to wired to the mains electricity which helps. The batteries are charged up by the solar panel and a full charge will allow the light to be on continuously for 30 minutes, however, this never happens as it comes on and only stays of on for a few seconds at a time. But, importantly, the batteries will allow the light to come on for approximately 72 times for about 25 seconds each time. But, at least they will be fully charged by the next night fall.

Sharp makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class. I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. This TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).  Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.  One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.   Additionally I found this mount to be very helpful http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00K69M0TY  The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:  This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.  With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.  As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.  Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of thisTV:  Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.

Purchased this not spontaneously however its sufficiently shoddy to do as such. Did a touch of examination clearly. I've got knee ligament harm. I abhor my knee prop its so uncomfortable so I thought I'd attempt this. Clearly not as strong its not intended to be. At the same time I have perceived in the month I've been utilizing it that I'm utilizing less painkillers (something to be thankful for) and my knee is less swollen. The main issue is it peels off rapidly under trousers. I've now purchased a fixer spread so I trust it progresses. I would prescribe for anybody with comparative knee issues.

I preferred this gardening set over others as it is heavy duty plastic instead of the tools made of metal. We felt the spade and gardening fork would be too dangerous for little ones if they were metal. The cute carrying case is a bonus. I would recommend this for 4 yrs. and up. We were very pleased!

This is a great sandbox playset. I got this for my little nephew, who loves to play in the sandbox in the garden. The variety of toys in this set is providing him with great fun and he already made a lot of creations he was very proud of.<br />The quality is great, the whole set is made of plastic, but the handles of the shovels and rake aren't bending or seem unstable.<br />Overall, this is a great toy set for a good price.

The product shipped out really quickly.Happy to see that the installation just attach to a rope and tie to a tree branch. The swing is sturdy can hold the bigger kids as well as the smaller kids. The adjustable height is perfect makes sure everyone can join on the fun.Bonus drainage hole no sitting water you have to drain out or watch for mosquitoes like the tire swings. The shape of the swing aids for great spin time

At $25, this is unbelievable quality.  The fabric is incredibly soft and it feels nicer to wear than anything else I own.<br /><br />The highlight though, is really the fit. It's GREAT!  I was a bit sceptical but it looks and fits exactly like the photograph.  It probably helps if you are in pretty good shape already or on the slim side.<br /><br />Postage time was ok.  It took 8 days for delivery (but still much better than Amazons estimated delivery time).  Well worth the wait!

This is an amazing device, i never taught of it that i could come across a very portable and handy knife sharpener like this one made from BlizeTec. My item arrived today and it was delivered in a perfect condition and as described by the seller. I got to test my device for the very first time with my blunt kitchen knife and it performed wonderfully well. It sharpened my kitchen knife excellently well and in few minutes am done with the sharpening. I realize i can use it for any of my blade-like tool at home, i tried it with the blade of my secateurs as and it sharpened it very well,i dare not scratch my hand across the blade of my knife and secateurs. Its portable and very handy, it can be taken to camping exercise and also taken along to anywhere, i realize that it can also be used for self defense in case of any attack.<br />Am really happy i got this, am happy i got a very good value for my money.<br />Excellent.

I work from home and was looking for a chair similar to those in my office. It was quite easy to put together and this Chair looks beautiful and the color is vibrant. Love it! As for comfort, cushion is like sitting on a cloud - but with support. The back supports you well  and very nice chair overall, very pleased. I was specifically looking for a breathable mesh chair w/ lumbar support and this chair fit both well. I highly recommend.

I see that there is a lot of negative reviews of this item. You may not be able to use this vest for take off and landing, but during the flight it is GREAT to be able to secure your baby. Especially if you are doing a long flight and you want to sleep yourself. Then you put on the vest on your baby, and then you attach it to your belt and you know that your baby can not fall down and in case of sudden turbulence he will not fall out (or up). That's how I have been using it anyway. It feels very safe to have my baby sleep with the vest on and then attached to me. If you fly with your baby in the lap, this is the only way to be able to be a little bit "hands free" during the flight, and know that your baby is safe.<br /><br />So far I have never been told I can't use this item on any airline.

This is a really great classic toy train set, the detail on the engine is incredible. I was really surprised by the power and speed that this has. I've played with a few in the toy store that cost more money and they all seem sluggish with mediocre sound effect and no smoke. The sound effects on this set are impressive and my son loves the smoke feature. The train set seems plenty durable but the engine has a lot of little detail pieces that could be broken easily if your child is very rough with it. My son loved the train so much that he had to sleep with the engine tonight!! :)

OMG! This is the olive oil of olive oils. I have never tasted anything like it. I don't know if it's that it is a single variety of olive, or very fresh according to the harvest year printed on the bottle, or just the land on which these olive trees are grown. This oil adds extraordinary flavor to anything you put it on and trust me, you're going to want to put it on everything! The website also shows the lab analysis, so it may be that it is so high in polyphenols. Love the burlap bag that it is delivered in. Will be giving these bottles as gifts. Thank you Menelaus for bringing a truly exceptional olive oil to the market.

The fact that I could order this device, program it for 5 minutes, stick it upside down in the sheepfold in my yard and now every time the weather sucks or my son hears a noise and tells me to go check on the lambs all I have to do is roll my eyes, pull out my iPhone and show him a LIVE VIDEO FEED of his lambs happily chewing on their grass . I can even hear them crunching on them! THAT IS AWESOME!<br /> I am going back to Amazon and ordering additional cameras.<br />NOTE though, every time you reboot your modem, you get new IP address.<br />and unless you find a way to make the address in your router to camera static. you need to check attached devices addresses, to access cam again . ALL easy.. once you learn it.<br />the wifi is just too handy.. anywhere there is power,within range of the router.. you got a remote view.

I purchased the nU Groove Sharpener last week from the company website and sat down to regroove my Titleist Vokey Spin MIlled wedges. I have had the wedges since 2009 and was deciding between buying new SM4s or trying the nU Groove Sharpener to restore the grooves. Spending over $300 to replace 3 of my wedges or $13 and minimal effort on my part, it was a no brainer.  After following the instructions provided and watching the video on their website, my vokeys' grooves are back to like new. Overall, it took about 20 minutes to do the 3 wedges. The nU Groove Sharpener was easy to use and will be a great addition in my bag for cleaning the grooves on the course.

I was a Morrowind addict throughout all of high school and college. I skipped Oblivion but jumped back in for Skyrim. But will never loose my love for that original immersal into the elder scroll series. When this came out I had to by it up.

with most of the games that are coming out this year are about war games, like call of duty and modern warfer three, this one is old but in it's time it was a pretty good game and was one of the best, now with black ops two is different.<br /><br />pretty much the gun will help you get more kills and have a faster reaction that you certainly don't have with the controller, for example when you are walking with the analog stick and you have to run faster you use your thump, and if someone comes out out of nowhere or if it's hiding you can't kill him, you saw it but didn't even get a change to shoot, well with this gun it has allowed me to do all that stuff i couldn't do, even though you're a good player you can't sometimes kill everyone.<br /><br />since the Wii came out, xbox and ps3 started making the same thing pretty much, and now no body wants the Wii anymore, the gun is in a pretty good design and is really comfortable. i love it and is easy to use it.

From the time I was 14 until I turned 50 in 2000, I was a dedicated "film" camera nut. In 1990, I graduated to a serious Nikon film camera and two quality lenses, a standard zoom and a telephoto zoom. Reluctantly, as the digital chatter started to fill most camera club discussions and magazines, I started to experiment with two advanced digital point-and-shoot cameras with a minimum of 10X optical zooms... each for a period of 4 years. The die was cast at that point, and I sadly found a storage spot for my beloved film gear. The second of the point-and-shoots was the Canon PowerShot S5 IS with the articulating LCD screen. I cannot begin to tell you the value of an articulating digital LCD screen that allows you to capture an eye level image of a blossom without the need to sit on the ground to do so. Or, capture several hours worth of a full lunar eclipse with a tripod mounted camera at a nearly overhead celestial body. That tilted screen made the job easier and saved lots of neck pain. So, from 2009 through the end of January (2011), I labored over which DSLR/lens combinations would take my "mad money". Being a Nikon man carried the ball, but I wanted that articulating LCD screen. Like buying a car, sometimes the little things carry the day.<br /><br />On February 1, 2011, I became the proud owner of a Canon DSLR. I purchased the Canon 60D body and two Canon "L" lenses: the f4 24-105mm IS USM standard zoom and the f2.8L 70-200mm IS II USM telephoto zoom. Sure, the camera body was significant, but lens quality takes your images to the NEXT level. I was confident with the decision, and now after a month of serious practice with the 60D/lens combinations, I am getting VERY satisfying image quality...sharp or soft depending on the subject. Not only does the camera body have the necessary articulating LCD screen, it allows me as much control as I choose...from full auto to standard settings, to the zone where I live...aperature-priority and shutter-priority. Living along the Atlantic Flyway, February can be a challenging month weather-wise but the Canon 60D and the lenses proved to be up to the task, especially when the first and last hours of light give you some truly spectacular wildlife opportunities and remarkable sunrises and sunsets.<br /><br />Just know that I don't spend my money recklessly and I expect results when I put my money down. Without a doubt, this camera body passed the February test in all kinds of lighting and temperatures ranging from 15 degrees to 65 degrees. I did little here to address the 60D's specs, but I now know this camera is not a Rebel and it's not a 7D. The controls and advanced features truly put the 60D in its own niche. If you want the specs, check the review by dojoklo dated Sept. 20, 2010.<br /><br />Bottom line: This camera is a good fit for a sports enthusiast, a dedicated nature/landscape lover, and the individual with a vision of digitally capturing "gallery" quality images. You are IN CONTROL with the 60D in your hands.

Was interested in the new Smart Bulbs after reading about them, I was ready to spend $200 when I found these bulbs on browsing through Amazon. The reviews were quite good and said they would be able to do the same as the Hue for 1/10 the price, I must admit I was a bit skeptical but figured for the price I could give them a try (and at worse purchase the Hue if they broke).<br />I can say the colors are very bright. The controller is simple and easy to use to change colors. They are great for party or evening dinner to dim the light or change the setting. The one thing I may say- the white light in these bulbs is a bit blue in color, so you may need to keep your normal white lights.<br />But for money, I am very happy w/ my buy- they do everything that is described. I have had these for 3 months now and still no problems. Thank you Torchstar!!!!<br />Many people reviewing mentioned articles in the New York Times and USA Today, so I decided to use google to take a look. My cousin had purchased similar bulbs and they were very cool. They changed the mood of karaoke party. For the price, I decided to try them and figure at worse I had wasted $20 to try a smart bulb. I have used these for 2 months and can share the following:<br />The bulb colors are very bright, particularly the blue color makes a cool mood. When turning off the bulb, it remembers the previous color setting, very smart. The remote is easy to use and all the functions work properly (considering the price I wasn't sure). My favorite feature is mixing colors- always love playing with it to create a new mood. The only thing I may say is these bulbs are more of a toy than a regular light.

This reflective vest has saved me life! Maybe it sounds a bit weird but it´s a fully true. I was on my way in the night to my home (on the bike) and there were everywhere dark. I have decided to use this vest and it was a best decision in my life. Only because of this vest one driver at the last moment stopped. I guess the main reason was a really bright color of this vest. I recommend it for everyone who ´s working in night or even in dark places. One day it could save your life as it saved mine in past. By the way there are lot of small pockets which could be used for keys, wallet and other important stuff.

Solved my problem instantly. My puppy would chase and nip at my kids when they were out in the yard and would not listen. There was no way of stopping her and I wasn't able to catch her. With this collar I have control to correct the behavior and it has worked like a charm. In fact, I do not even have to use anything other then the vibration. I am so glad that I do not have to actually shock her and this collar offers the vibration. Many of them do not. Great product. Super satisfied!

Went into this purchase not expecting much and I was glad to see that it was well worth the bucks. I'm not sure how I made it through living up North all my life never having the luxury of heated seats! This seat cover is a gem and I don't know what I'd do without it now. The elastic strap works well enough for me and it doesn't seem to slide around much so I'm happy. The only thing that I feel I should note is that you DEFINITELY have to unplug the cushion when it's not in use so that you don't run down your battery. Other than that, it's pretty easy to get the hang of and awesome to have every winter!

So i bought both the 2 pack and 5 pack last year. One for me and one for my parents. I waited so long to write the reviews because i wanted to see if they are really what they say they are.<br /><br />One very big thing for me for these cleaning cloth is that they always break so easily-the strings on the edges always come out after a couple months of use. So i was worried if mimogram would be the same as the other ones i've purchased. But guess what, they are not!! My mimogram cloths still look like new! They are not only easy to use and clean very well, the material is also very durable. I even receive compliments from my parents and asking me to purchase some more for their friends!!

This is a very good camera bag for both an amateur or a professional who's going on a day trip and only wants to bring along one extra lens.

My hubby Dub gets his Canon 7D with a 24-105 on it in the main pouch, a Speedlite flash in one side pouch,  a 17-40 wide angle in the other side and a diffuser and extra batteries in the front pouch so he's good to go for just about any situation.

I purchased both the Fortress Security System and Skylink Security System. Results...I recommend Skylink to everyone over the Fortress product. Skylink offers more quality and features, the system and sensors were very easy to set-up. Within minutes I was in the testing mode. As for the Fortress system, ughh unnecessary headache! 2 hours later the system was still not communicating properly. Long story short...I returned Fortress and kept my Skylink system as it works as advertised, was easy to set-up, has no contracts and plenty of sensors I can add at very good prices. If you want to save money, Skylink is the source!

I purchased these to keep my exploring 18 month old twins out of our entertainment center.  My friend has one of these: http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B007A2ZSZ8/  We have two glass doors they just loved to open. Applying them was easy, but unfortunately one of my girls tugged on the strap before it was really set and ripped the back latch (the one we don't use) off the wood. It wouldn't stick now so I just pulled out some of my extra command strips and stuck it down. It's mostly out of sight so we don't see the tabs and it works great! The locks are pretty large and unsightly, but they get the job done and they can't figure it out (yet). I'm sure by 3 or so they'll discover they just have to push the buttons and boom! Access to whatever. But they are excellent for now.  It would be nice if they supplied extra adhesive just in case (or for reuse). It'd also be nice if they made them in a black, and a brushed and polished silver color too, just to make them look slightly nicer.  They accomplish what I wanted at an excellent price, would recommend!  Edit: September 7, 2013:  My daughters are now over two years old and still cannot get into these. I put them on all cabinets in our kitchen now as well. If I leave one off on accident they try to put it back on but can't. They have very small hand and not much strength in them so I have confidence that these will last for a long time.   You really have to push the side buttons and pull it off, my daughters can't do this. To apply the ones in my kitchen I removed the adhesive provided on the lock all together and stuck it on with command strips instead to save the cabinets in our rental house. My daughters pull and pull on them and even using command strips instead of the provided adhesive they haven't been able to pull them off. Still love them!  I hope this review was helpful!

I was a bit suspicious in the beginning as to how you could learn so many negotiation tricks in such a short time considering that negotiation skills are usually taught in 2 or 3 day seminars. I have already been to a few such seminars, and of course, a DVD cannot fully replace such a course. On the other hand, if you consider how much of those multi-day seminars I actually apply to my current job right now, the list would certainly be longer for the DVD than for the seminars. I think this is because the negotiation tips on the DVD are very clear and simple. I can easily remember many of the examples and use/adapt them during my own negotiations.<br /><br />The description of the DVD is actually very acurate: A lot of good negotiation tricks in a simple format without much theory of fancy graphics. Instead, everything is explained via examples focussing on how you can reapply them to your situation as fast as possible. So, if you are like me and like this approach, this DVD is perfect for you. If you prefer learning via theory and methods, you are likely better off buying one of the many detailed books available on the market. Or you do both.

I have a 2008 Miata, and those Mazda folks, they make a zippy little roadster, but the stock windscreen just doesn't cut it. I got this deflector because it works along with the stock windscreen. I'd stay it increases blockage by 3X. That is, when I'm driving at 20 MPH with just the stock windscreen, it feels like I'm driving at 60 MPH with this windscreen in place. So this deflector certainly does an effective job and makes driving top-down in my little Miata much better. Shipping was fast and securely packaged, so overall good job.

These are relatively small sized diamond bits. I use them to drill holes in glass for making lamps out of wine bottles. They work just fine and I am very satisfied with their performance.

GORGEOUS!  This is a high quality bag that is large enough to use as a diaper bag if you so choose, but small enough to be an every day carry purse.  The first thing I generally look at is the seams.  Are they high quality or single stitching.. these are definitely high quality stiched seams.  There are no frays, it is beautiful.  It can be used as a shoulder bag, or you can carry simply with the 2 carry handles.  The bag comes with the additional strap to be added for shoulder carry.  The inside of the purse has 2 large sections, separated by a full size zippered pocket center.  There is a zippered pocket on the outside and inside along the shell, and 2 pockets on the opposite inside.  It is genuine leather, and you can tell that as soon as you open the package.  It just smells of that wonderful new leather scent.  A very nice bag in every way, even down to  the small details and embellishments.  I am in love.

This is quite a bit larger than the tripod I'm currently using. Quite a bit more sturdy too. One gets the sense that you could put a swing set for a small child, or a big one if you have room, under this tripod and it wouldn't move an inch. I know that I feel plenty secure when I have my camera with a telephoto lens on this thing.<br /><br />Yes, this tripod is expensive. Yes it is for professionals, but if you're an amateur like me, I think you'll find this maybe a bit to expensive, but that being said, this is all the tripod you'll ever need.

I have been drinking lipton iced tea for what seems like forever. If you drink a lot of tea, then the packaging is perfect for you. Everyone in my family drink iced tea so it is nice to be able to quickly and easily make a gallon without much mess. I would also recommend this iced tea mix, [[ASIN:B009PIEW3O 100% Pure Instant Iced Tea Powder (Unsweetened) 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]. It comes in a resealable foil bag so whether you want to make a bunch or just a cup its quick and easy to do. Plus it is literally the only tea I've tasted that actually rivals lipton without even adding any sweetener to it, really really good.

Over the years we remodeled a few homes and we have bought many electric wall heaters, and we final stuck with this Stelpro. We like the metal cover over others that we have seen and used. The cover has a smooth rounded look to it, we standing over it you can’t see the internal parts like the fan. Some times with mount it vertically or horizontally all depending on what is above the heater. Because it’s so compact we are able to install in just about anywhere. Its shipped by UPS and we got it that same week double boxed.

Dependability is as stated. With the device and the Torque pro app there doesn't appear to be anything I can't monitor, graph and compare! As a troubleshooting tool it will prove to be invaluable. And if you're looking for the 'cool' factor...this is it. I can set up more glass instruments in my truck than I ever thought possible. I was initially concerned about ordering one of the Chinese made scan tool adapters. But the many reviewers convinced me it was a great product at a great price. I agree. These devices are really convenient. I have bought them for both myself and friends and it has caught on as a gift idea. Works well with an Android phone and the Torque Pro App. It gives you real time telemetry and extensive information and from the app you can look up the things to look for in a vehicle specific manner for the diagnosis code.

I just bought this as a replacement and went for an RFID because I just got my new credit cards and this come with a chip. This really meat my expectations, and here are a couple of observations after a couple of weeks of using this. The RFID blocking works well; the wallet completely blocked the card reader I tried at a fast food restaurant, when paying for a meal no matter which way I turned the wallet the scanner did not read my cards. It appears to be a good quality leather, and it's well made. I like that it has enough pockets for all my credit cards, and really like the ID flip out and the currency divider.<br /><br />Overall Good quality for the price. Seems as good as, if not better than, some of the wallets that are 2x the cost

I loved Altair, but Ezio is the best assassin of the series by far. I will have to say this trilogy is the best ASSASSIN'S games but I enjoyed Black Flag much more but it's not really an assassin's game as it is a pirates game. The graphics are a little dated, and ACII and Brotherhood mechanics were lacking up until he gains his hook blade in Revelations. Great games though, definitely worth buying. After you finish Revelations, watch Assassin's Creed Embers to close Ezio's story. I wish they would do more birth-death AC, brings you closer to the character.

Fits well with my  http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00069E0E2  My sister knew that I thought Occidental bags were the best ones out there and she picked out this pair for me. I feel a little guilty because I only use the bags on the weekend when I build at Habitat (they deserve to be used daily) but you just can't find better than these.   There's a place for everything you need and I always have plenty of fasteners. I am quickly getting the reputation for having everything in my bags because I just have so much room.  My only (very very small) complaint is that the cell phone holder does not accommodate an iPhone. I really don't mind, however, because the cell phone holder is just clipped on so I slide it off and therefore it doesn't take up any room with a pouch that I can't use.   I prefer to keep my phone in my car while I'm building anyways.  I hope this review was helpful!

I need to see my kitchen supplies and food using bright light. This is dimmable light so you can adjust it if you want.

Due to a back injury, I was no longer able to move my boat trailer around the bend in my driveway to the garage. The Trailer Valet has given me a solution.

This double stroller is a wonderful value. It is good quality and good looking. It is light weight and easy to maneuver. The only thing I am disappointed in is that it said it was reclining but the only two positions are as shown or straight up. You also have to use a belt in the back to adjust that. Not very easy to use. Overall though I enjoy this stroller and it is always in the car ready to go for my twin baby girls!

That just makes them fresher and a lot tastier compared to the others. This is definitely a must-try, especially if you love coffee!

I am in love with this mirror! My main reason for purchasing this one was that it appeared that the wood would match my bedroom set - and it did perfectly! It looks much higher priced than it was (I paid $48). It is definitely smaller than you might think. I was glad I had read other reviews before purchasing so I knew what to expect. But, I was not disappointed because even at 5'9", I can see my whole self with no problems. Mirror is a great quality (not a fun-house mirror at all). It has a very clean, modern look. Super easy to assemble (a few twists and screws and voila!). I am very happy with this mirror and would recommend it.<br /><br />The only downside was that the first time I ordered it, it wasn't delivered because it was damaged on the last leg of its journey. Amazon was very helpful though and upgraded my shipping for free when I ordered another one. This one arrived on time and in great shape.

At first glance, I didn't expect much from a golden Oreo cookie. The tradition of the Oreo has worked perfectly for decades and now there's a golden version of it? Nah, that couldn't be any good, could it?<br /><br />But then I popped one in my naive mouth.<br /><br />So good. SO GOOD. The birthday cake Oreo could be my new favorite cookie! Tastes like funfetti too. I quickly grabbed as many as I could fit into my desperate hands and retreated back to my lair. Let me tell you this - limiting yourself to just one will be impossible. Resistance is futile.<br /><br />The cream is a bit sweeter than the regular Oreo, and the wafer might be yellow cake or something. It's actually not clear what the wafer flavor is supposed to be. Either way, I hope the birthday cake Oreo sticks around. They've got something here...

These are the best packing cubes! Their quality and construction are great. You can pack so much more using cubes as they compress your clothes and they also keep things less wrinkled because there is less movement of contents inside your suitcase. It is so much easier to organize your clothes and when you get to your hotel all you need to do is remove a cube and put it in the drawer. I had purchased a less expensive packing cube set and the zippers were horrible.

[[VIDEOID:8fe5fcba5508be458947060a02ccea99]] As we only received this carrier yesterday, we haven't had time to test it on our cat. It had to be assembled, and apart from some rudimentary instructions on the label, there were no directions to show us clearly how to put it together. However, this only took a few minutes. On unpacking, my initial feeling was that it looked rather flimsy, but now that it is assembled, it seems a neat,sturdy and well-designed pet carrier. Our previous carrier was not well put-together, and it was always a struggle to get our cat installed. I wanted one which would make travelling to the vet or to the cattery as stress-free for her as possible, and this one ticks all the boxes.

It easily held a change of clothes for an adult & child, hats & sunglasses, camera, keys, wallet, 2 water bottles...water resistant, machine washable, dries quickly, stuffs easily back into its own pocket.

These 5-Watt Dimmable GU10 LED bulbs are awesome. They are exact replacements for the original halogen GU10 bulbs in my track lighting fixtures. I really love these bulbs and have outfitted my entire living-dining room with them. They are only warm to the touch, even after hours of being on, and hardly use any electricity. The color temperature is exactly what I'd hoped for, being a nice warm white. Plenty of light output, easy to install, and very inexpensive as compared to other LED bulbs in the stores.

Here there are some things that I like about this coffee table: it's relatively inexpensive, it's easy to move around--very lightweight, looks very nice and seems fairly sturdy.<br />Now what I don't like about it: itmight scoot across the floor at the slightest bump, being so light. I'm not sure, since the room I'm using it in is carpeted. I also think it would probably scuff/dent easily, so if you want it to stay nice and have children.....it probably won't happen. However, please remember that it is quite cheap…

This seasoning has forever changed food for me. I LOVE FOOD! (who doesnt haha) but adding the Flavor God Everything seasoning, to literally EVERYTHING has been a life changing experience for me! Its absolutely exceeds every expectation I had. I first came across their products on their Instagram account and was very intrigued. I saw so many photos shared of chicken, and other foods with this seasoning sprinkled on them. I saw a whole bunch of recipes that literally made my mouth water. I knew I had to try it!<br /><br />Once I ordered it I couldnt wait to get it, constantly seeing photos of delicious food with this added to the recipes I knew it was going to be out of the world. I love that this product is low in sodium and gluten free. Due to a thyroid disorder Ive had to change my diet drastically and it makes me happy knowing that I can sprinkle this seasoning onto food and actually enjoy my meal! I dont have to worry about my food tasting bland, I know I can always add this to everything! My boyfriend who is a very picky eater is obsessed with it too! The taste is just out of this world!<br /><br />This seasoning has so many good flavors packed into it. ( garlic, onion, cumin, paprika, etc. ) Ive recently started putting it on veggies such as potatoes and avocados, it makes all food so much more enjoyable.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this product!<br />Flavor god is an amazing company that is constantly expanding. They now even have a desert seasoning that I cant wait to try!

What a neat mini video camera. It was an easy set up. I charged the device for 8 hours and afterwards I glanced over the first few paragraphs of the updated user instructions. This item does not require batteries. It has an internal battery. I purchased a MICRO SDHC memory card for storage as needed and a 8 GB was only twelve dollars at Walgreens. It was so simple: Charge device using the charger provided and insert the memory card and press the on button.  You also have a choice of three video recording modes. When the video camera is working correctly you will see a blinking green light.  Don't be surprised if you are already recording while learning to use the camera. This happened to me. Next I wanted to figure out how to play back a video. Wow it took me under five minutes to figure out how. First plug the video camera into your computer by using the USB cord provided. Now go to the start menu and click on Your Computer. Look for the correct drive where your camera is located. Now if you are in the right place it will have a file that opens and says DVR. Doubled click on the DVR and you will see instant video with playback options. I couldn't believe how beautifully clear the picture was! The Megapixels in HD are awesome in the video recordings. I am impressed. The size is very compact. This will definitely come in handy!

I am a crafter it's my passion. When I saw these lights I just had to get them. They are the perfect size being only 1 and a quarter inches in length. They are water proof and they are solid in design. They are durable and I love that these ones don't blink. They look so amazing in paper lanterns. I made a bunch for our local school carnival.<br /><br />The little eyelet at the base of the light made it easier to pull them into place. Bu just placing a piece of thin string or ribbon in the eyelet and looping it down.to pull it down into place. For being tiny lights they sure do give off enough light. I love the way they illuminate the paper Lanterns. Another idea I'm working on for Christmas is holiday bells I took some shot glass size plastic clear cups punched a small hole in the bottom and pull the light through and I have my silver bells to hang along my arch way on Christmas eve to light the way for Santa when he comes.<br /><br />These are by far the best lights I have come across to work with for crafting. They are excellent quality batteries last a long time at least 8 hours and they are cheap to replace.

There is no doubt that this tea works wonders for increasing milk production. Within two days of drinking it 4-5 times a day I had more than enough milk. Actually my milk supply doubled! I am not a tea drinker so to me the taste is not very good. However increasing my milk supply is of course more important than the taste of the tea so if it didn't cause a terrible case of gas in my daughter than I would not have anything negative to say about it. But it made her so gassy that she did not sleep for almost an entire day.<br /><br />I suggest others to start with one or two bags per day to see if it has any negative side effects on your baby. I know it doesn't happen to everyone, I'm just one of the lucky one's I guess.<br /><br />I have since switched to taking fenugreek and blessed thistle capsules and I am again producing more milk than ever without any of the side effects the tea gave my daughter -[[ASIN:B00AAQIP5G Nature's Way Blessed Thistle (390mg) 100 Capsules + FREE Fenugreek (610mg) 100 Capsules]]. So, whatever it was that caused the gas in my baby, it doesn't appear to be the fenugreek or blessed thistle. I personally prefer the capsules anyways since I was not crazy about the flavor of this tea anyways.

This is a very rich black tea. Imagine earl grey with vanilla, fruit, and citrus all mixed in together. I have been enjoying this for a little while now and it really has allowed me to come to appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into making earl grey tea. This tea, interestingly enough, actually has more of a subtle taste instead of the more power packed traditional types of earl grey, which is certainly nice for a change now and again.<br /><br />Try it with sugar and milk or just some good old fashioned honey. This also made me even more curious to examine different flavor combinations and varieties of earl grey tea. Another great tasting variety is a hearty earl grey crème ([[ASIN:B00HFMS74C Organic Black Loose Leaf Tea: Earl Grey Creme 4 oz. + FREE Bamboo Tea Strainer]]), with the addition of some very good French vanilla and has a very strong and rich finish. The aroma is also something to take notice of as well: very powerful and rich.

You wouldn't be ashamed to show it the video to your friends. The photos came out really good, too. This camera definitely change my first impression about it.‏

When I put my pants on in the morning, the Streamlight 2L & holster is on my belt<br /><br />I normally use the low power to light the trail after the sun goes down when I'm out hiking.  It is more than adequate for illuminating 25-30 feet in front,  The ambient light provides me with all the peripheral light I need.<br /><br />I've given the 2L as a gift to a friend, who also now carries it with him all the time.<br /><br />When geocaching on a bright day, the high power lights up the cracks & crevices I need to loo in to find those micro caches.<br /><br />It takes a little practice to become proficient in switching from High Power, to Strobe, to LOW power.<br /><br />I'd like to suggest that when you buy the 2L that you also purchase a 6 pack of batteries.<br /><br />I bought the 2L back in November, am just as happy after carrying & using it for the last 6 months today, as I was when I first bought it

My friends are jealous by my ratchet set. They can't steal my tools because they are black. These tools look and feel quality. The case isn't the best, but I don't have any real major problems with it. It can be difficult to get the pieces in and out of the toolbox depending on the part. I like the fact that it comes with an extending rod. That is the thing that the smaller sets needed. This was a great value.

When i purchased my Ford F150 XLT Crew Cab it did not come with floor mats.  I didn't notice it until the deal was made and i had already arrived home.  I removed all of the dealership paper mats to find no floor mats underneath!  I looked in the back seat, nothing, so i did some research here on amazon and quickly discovered that Husky had WAY better reviews than their competitors.  The price does seem a little high, but let me tell you, its worth it.  If you HAVE to buy floor mats because the truck didn't come with any.  You can't pick a better mat.  I am currently ordering a set for my girlfriend's Camry because she liked them so much.

This LED light actually gives off a very soft and pleasing light. We've been using it in our house for a couple months now and we like it a lot. The only issue is that it's quite a bit heaver than a normal light, but we don't care, but if you had a fragile little lamp, you might. They say this light will last an average of 22 years. That's a long time and makes this light a very good deal.

These LEDs are the best! They are so lovely and magical when you use them, I used them for my new-year décor. Not expecting much out of them, It made my new-year party magical with its fairy like effects and was pleasantly surprised as soon as I plugged them in – the glow is beautiful, soft, and bright. Alone, they were able to light up the entire garden! By the time the holidays ended, I was too in love to put them out in the shed with the rest of the decorations.  I presently use them as my outdoor garlands.

It is a multifunctional camera, you are able to take photos with it and also to video recording in full HD resolution.

When I went back to work, when my daughter was 6 months old, I had to find an alternative to breast feeding.  I did a lot of research before choosing this formula.  We couldn't afford to buy Baby's Only and this was a good alternative at a reasonable price.<br />I did take the prior reviews, about the ingredients, in to account before deciding to purchase.  I understand the concerns about some of the ingredients, but everything we eat has been contaminated by chemicals these days.  Therefore, I think you have to do your research, take any concerns in to consideration and then make the best decision for you and your baby.<br />Our daughter has been on this for 6 months now and is doing really well - she loves to drink this, is putting on an appropriate amount of weight and is healthy and happy.  What more could you ask for?

Great feeding system when you don't have two hands. I was struggling with the traditional bottles and was subject to performing a juggling act when traveling. Switched to these and they work great! Took the baby a little time to get used to the bottle, but after a few tries he is now a pro. This is totally amazing and it works great. My daughter played with it for a while because she is used to holding a bottle with a nipple attached. But it only took her a few minutes to figure it out. Now she drinks with the nipple in her mouth and uses her hands to play with toys.

I love to snack on hempseeds!! They're very tasty and they have a texture similar to sunflower seeds which I love. They make a great addition to salads and other light dishes because they give you just enough consistency to help feel more full. Since finding these organic seeds, I've noticed a serious change in my eating habits which has really helped me to look and feel better! I keep a bag with me at work to munch on throughout the day.<br /><br />There are instances where the shelled seeds aren't ideal though. For those, and for added flavor in my salads, I use hempseed oil ([[ASIN:B00AAQY2T4 Nutiva Organic Hemp Oil 24 oz. + FREE 100% Cococare Coconut Oil - 4 fl oz]]) instead. It's all the same perks but in a different form. The taste is just as pure and if you blend the hemp oil and coconut oil together, you'll be hooked! It's the perfect balance of light and dark without being too heavy or bold tasting. I make up for my lack of omega-3 consumption with all my hempseeds. Even my husband loves them and he's a heavy chip and snack eater!

My family uses the grill most of the summer months so I purchase the bigger containers of seasonings for our meats. This seasoning is a mix between sweet and salty with just the right amount of smoke flavor. My marinade for unthawed chicken breasts and pork loin: In a gallon ziplock bag use 1 tbsp sugar, 1 cup italian dressing and 4 tbsp of the smokehouse seasoning. Mix well and let marinade over night in the fridge. I also use the McCormicks Montreal for steak/burgers and buy it at a Warehouse store where it is cheaper but they do not carry this flavor. Of course, I buy this flavor from amazon because it is only two dollars more and I get free shipping without having to drive to different stores searching for it...

This is absolutely marvelous. I have been using this bag for my business tours, and I'm really enthralled to know how spacious it is. Perfect size, retro army style, cow leather with high durability. There are four pockets on the outside of the bag, it allows me to put in petty stuff that I need while I am on the run. I've got a 15&#34; business Netbook and it fits in quite well alongside my black coat. To be honest, it kind of feels like it overweighs, but thanks to the quality; it stays intact.<br />Besides the delivery was right on time by the Amazon just like always, shipping was free of cost. However, I hope they bring in more colors of a similar texture since I am not the biggest fan of Army green. Also, I love how affordable this Duffel bag is. All in all, I would highly recommend to buy this bag, well worth the price.

I have a very active life, if I am not on the bike I am on foot as I am trying to keep fit. I have gone through a series of watches over the years and just need a straightforward watch for sports. So many of the watches I have had have not been able to stand up to the rigors of an active lifestyle. That was until I was recommended this watch and I have not looked back since.<br /><br />The various functions are very useful for the sports man but most importantly the strap and design are really well built for the active lifestyle. The watch is also waterproof which is great because in the winter I love to swim as an alternative to biking in the cold so I can keep the watch on, great for timing my laps. This is great watch that actually does stand up to the rigors of an active lifestyle.

I bought this set for use in my chicken coop. Distance is about 80' from the house, and it transmits perfectly and very clearly. I can hear the chickens both when they are in their coop and when I let them out into their fenced-in yard (which was my original intent in buying the monitors, because of hawks and other predators). Now I can relax, because I can hear if they become distressed and can run out to chase off any predators. I keep one receiver in the kitchen and one in the bedroom, so I can hear wherever I am in the house. I found that I just enjoy listening to the chickens cluck and cackle to one another throughout the day. The &#34;talk&#34; feature also comes in handy when my husband and I are doing chores, as we can communicate between the coop and the house. The transmitter needs to be plugged in at all times, but it has a nice long cord that enables me to hang it at a convenient location. The receivers run off rechargeable batteries and each has its own charging unit. Very reliable, easy to use.

If you're looking for a solution for an outdoor light that basically takes care of itself without the need of a mains electric power source then look no further! Once activated and put in place, this light offers an ample amount of light for highlighting those areas which are a little too dark when the sun goes down. I ordered two of these and have one right above my front door (for finding my keys that bit easier when I arrive home), and also one by my gate (so anyone coming in at night has some light to illuminate the path to the door). Let's also not forget they are a good security option for informing you of people approaching when put out of arms reach. The light gives off a dim glow throughout the night and switches to a really bright LED option when the motion sensor picks up movement. The light then turns back to it's dim setting around 10 seconds after. Perfect! The best part about these is their green energy efficiency where they charge throughout the day via the solar panel on the top of them. I'm going to be buying another one of these and I highly recommend them as a cheap option to solve your night time exterior light problems and also to add a dash of security to areas of your property.

The difference in taste between tea bags and the loose tea leaves has to be tasted to be believed.  I bought my first box of Lipton and I'm really impressed with the taste, especially for this price.  Just don't expect it to be able to hold ground with most of the premium teas out there, but for someone new to loose teas, I would recommend to them in a heartbeat.<br /><br />And if you like the taste of this Lipton black tea, I'd suggest also trying this sampler; [[ASIN:B00HC582FQ Organic Black Teas Loose Tea Trio Sampler - Earl Grey Crème, Sweet Almond Wild Berry, Pumpkin Spice Chai]].  A little different from the plain black teas, these are full-bodied and full of flavor...depending on the blend.<br /><br />This is why I love loos leaf teas sooo much.  Each one is different from the next, all with their own personality and flavor.  Oh and If you like pumpkin pie, you'll fall in love with the pumpkin spic chai in that sampler.  Simply to die for.

For the longest time I've been using a small garbage can with a makeshift device to have it on the back of the car seat. But it was so bulky and a pain. This bag is amazing and I wish I would have known about this type of thing before. It fits easily onto any seat of any car. It just wraps around the headrest (or wherever you wish top put it). It already has some trash in it and I love it takes up not much space. I haven't tried anything liquid in it yet, but it does look leak proof as the info says it is. I'll probably buy some more of these for our other car and maybe for friends too. For the price its hands down worth it!

This is an exceptional little light. I like that it has four settings, has a rechargeable battery, and is very east to carry around or hang in a closet. I have mine hanging in a hall closet that doesn't get much light from the hallway light, and this thing lights it up very well. The highest regular setting is more than adequate to provide very bright light where needed. The lower setting also give out a good amount of light for smaller areas.<br /><br />This will be a great light to have when power goes out, or for times you just need more light for projects around the house. I am very pleased with this purchase and plan to get a few more to have on hand for when there are power outages. Definitely recommend this!

I use it for http://www.amzn.gift/dp/B0002C7FHC Great price and super fast shipping. I've bought these several times over the past couple of years and they last just as long as the name brand. Replacing batteries in 3 dog collars can get spendy so I really appreciate the quality and price here.   After buying a couple of bark control collars, I discovered that the batteries were pretty expensive ($12.99 for a 2-pack at the same store) and they were almost always out of stock. These are a perfect fit and work just as well or better than the stock batteries. And you get 10 of them for what you'd pay for 3! And it's always nice to have extras on hand so you don't have to make a special trip (and where I live it's a 30-mile trip to the nearest pet store).  I hope this review was helpful! - J

This is the best caramel/chocolate combination I have ever tasted. The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.<br />The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.<br />At the very least try the Ghiradelli.

I bought 3 Foscam camera about 1/2 an year ago from the positive online reviews. I now regretted it because 1 of them no longer connects to my router or internet, the other one image now fades pinkish red, and the last one I have no idea how long it will last. The quality is simply bad. I wished I could've found this security camera before.<br /><br />When my Foscam failed, i decided first to buy a different brand so I first chose dropcam. The dropcam picture quality is great and with very few lags but I was reluctant to pay for the monthly cloud because it was simply an expensive investment of $9.95 a month or $99 a year. Luckily, my coworker told me about this camera and I glad I got it. Here are few reasons why this is one of the best home security camera:<br /><br />1. Picture quality and color is as good as dropcam or perhaps better. Both my PC and android viewing are super sharp. foscam is a joke in comparison to this.<br />2. Barely any lag for WiFi viewing. My T-Mobile 4g takes about 3 to 5 seconds to boot up and with decent lag<br />3. the two way audio sounds really clear and loud.<br />4. Most important is the setup. I got this camera running in probably 5 minutes including unboxing. The user manual is only 1 sheet of a paper. No complicated setup like other brands of camera.<br />5. Video can be stored in a mico SD card. No monthly service or subscriptions required.<br /><br />I am planning to replace my remaining cam after my next paycheck to this one and going to return my Dropcam. Overall, I can only say this is the best security camera in the market. I highly recommend it, trust me, you won't regret.<br /><br />Courtney W.

The materials are durable, yet not hard, so I don't have to worry about this scratching anything in my pockets.<br /><br />Great product if you're looking to ditch the fat wallet!

This is a rechargeable and waterproof dog training collar. We have 3 dogs, 1 of whom requ'd an extra level of obedience training. This unit seemed to help out an awful lot.<br /><br />The package claims to work up to 330 yards remote control - we do not have that large a yard so I can not speak on the accuracy of this range. We found it worked well within our 50 yard boundary. It has 3 modes: static shock / vibration / beep.<br /><br />It was convenient to use and our dog could not wiggle out of it, as she tried a number of times. WE DID NOT TEST THE SHOCK FEATURE, only the vibration, and that provided enough stimulation to re-direct our dog's attention once she was not obeying commands. We did not test the shock only for fear of not knowing if there would be a malfunction.<br /><br />All in all, this is a quality product which does what it claims to do, and CAN assist you with training your dog if used properly.

Not familiar with the brand, I bought the variety pack on a whim and I finally have found a K-Cup coffee I will go back to on a consistent basis. Realizing that coffee roasts are subjective to each individual, I have found all varieties I've tried so far to be delicious. The Corner Donut Shop roast is right in my wheelhouse. For something more bold, I tend to favor the Fugheddaboutit. And this company has done one more thing...produced a flavored coffee that I actually enjoy - the Maple Sleigh. Good things all around.<br /><br />I haven't tried all the flavors yet but this is one variety pack that I'm excited to try. Keep up the great work Brooklyn Beans. As Buddy the Elf said &#34;You did it! Congratulations! World's best cup of coffee! Great job everybody!&#34;

I consider myself a tea snob. It's suitable when you're an American and you take your tea as seriously as the Englishmen do. This is one of the best and most true-to-advertising English brands I've ever come across. I really look for the boldest of flavors when it comes to my tea and this is one of them. The cup doesn't taste watered down which is so important.<br /><br />I'd be lying if I said there weren't mornings when I really need a pick me up and one bag doesn't do it for me. When I run into those days I add a pinch of pure black tea powder ([[ASIN:B009PIAFTE All Natural Organic Instant Black Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]) and I don't have to waste a whole other bag. The English really know what they're doing so 2 bags will kind of knock you on your behind. It's really affordable to have the powder as an additive.

honestly i don't know what is the problem with the negative reviews for this product because it really works, and probably they just didn't know how to use it the right way, but for my PSP is fantastic and i know that there is other ways to transfer music to my PSP but truthfully it takes a lot of time to transfer them and with the help of the PSP Max Media Pro is very easy now.<br /><br />the stuff i have transferred from my computer to my PSP is exactly the same as i have it on my computer, the quality doesn't change. this should be pretty easy to use if you are familiarized with computers and music downloads and all that stuff, if you think it will not be easy for you trust me that it will. all you have to do is follow the directions given to you in the manual.<br /><br />one of the cons is that you definitely cannot transfer movies from DVD, and is understandable because you should have the movie saved in the hard drive of your computer in order to transfer it to your PSP.<br /><br />highly recommended product!

I am not a sci-fi fan really and the commercials for the movie did not appeal to me as a movie I wanted to see.<br /><br />But after the reviews and the Academy Award nominations, I broked down and got this.  It is a wonderful movie in terms of direction, acting and the visual effects.  Blu-ray and the largest television in your house for this.<br /><br />Bullock delivers an incredible performance and you are immersed in the struggle for survival and have a sense of the vast depths of space.

I put on the earrings the minute they arrived, and I have not taken them off since. (I think it has been three weeks? :) Personally, I think the size is just right - but then, my taste runs to the small and understated. (I have gold balls the exact same size, and most reviews thought they were too small as well.) The diamond is about three millimeters - look at a ruler before buying this, and you will not be surprised. It is a great earring for second piercing (in the same ear), or you can use both in the same ear, and do something different in the other ear, if you like that kind of effect. I think it looks great.  I will be the first to admit that I know very little about diamonds, but prior to ordering these earrings, I did some reading on the four c's. I also compared the price to similar carats and cuts on other sites, and most were more expensive while having inferior color and clarity.

This snorkel, like all Cressi products, is of the best quality, and has a great price. When I order a new snorkel I normally have to check the mouth piece and make sure that aren't any sharp edges that need to be filed down, but I never have to do that with Cressi, they are made differently than other brands. This snorkel is very comfortable and doesn't leak when submerged, in addition, it clears very quickly and easily when you come up.

My lab-mix used to have a wonderful thick coat. She's somewhat allergic, so she's on a hypoallergenic food and I used to give her with Fish oil, vitamin A, E and D and 3V Skin Caps. http://amzn.to/1Dqissc<br /><br />When 3V discontinued the Skin Caps, I switched her to another brand that was recommended as an equivalent. In no time at all she started to develop dry patches on her sides which quickly went bald. I investigated the guaranteed analysis of the &#34;new&#34; skin caps and realized they didn't have the same dosage of specific vitamins that the old ones had.<br /><br />I researched BodSmith for Dogs and realized that it would easily deliver the deficiency of vitamins she was missing, and then some! She's been on them for about a month and at first I was afraid to believe it, but the hair is finally growing back! I highly recommend this product if your dog has any skin issues. It works!<br /><br />Seriously, if you love your dog get http://amzn.to/1DqiwYU

So I was part of a test group for this product. My dog, Trixy, is an 8 year old shih tzu and has had bad arthritis for about a year and a half. Our daily strolls were becoming more and more painful for her. My vet recommended a number of things but I wanted something natural that worked. Boom! I found this product! After a few weeks I noticed Trixy was moving better. She would spring out of bed in the morning and had an extra pep in her step. She still has her bad days, especially when it's cold or rainy, but the improvement overall has been huge. I recommend Advanced Joint Supplement and so does Trixy!!

I don't often write reviews, but this piece of gear is worthy. I've owned this watch for about 2 months now, and all I can say about it is that it's awesome!  I bought this  http://fave.co/1bKVxeD  I do MMA training, hiking, salt water kayaking, getting in to rock climbing, and general training for Tough Mudder and other mud/endurance runs, and needed something to help me take it to the next level as carrying my iPhone just was not great as a lot of times you need your hands and I don't like having it attached to my arm or waste and definitely not in a pocket.  It does everything that's advertised, and is pretty easy to use...much easier to use then my last watch which I returned to REI  http://fave.co/1c3A4OI  It was not a 1/4 of what this watch is, but it was half the cost. The other one felt somewhat flimsy, and one of the buttons stopped working after about 6 months...I am hard on gear though as I buy it to actually do what it's supposed to do - intense workouts, hiking, hunting, fishing, etc. This one the buttons are very firm and well built, and feel like they will hold up, but only time will tell. I've hit this watch pretty hard multiple times so far and only have a few small and hard to notice scuff marks to show for it in the aluminum face.  What is really amazing is the recharging and connectivity to the MoveScout site, which you can use to update and customize the watch as well as go over your past workouts and see where you need to up your workout to keep your heart rate up. If you're running it shows what your heart rate was during each part of your run as well as your pace, etc...very useful so you know where to up your intensity.  Would I buy this item again, hell yes...I will buy another one when/if I break this one. I was also thinking about getting a dive watch like a Omega Seamaster, http://amzn.to/1ytLgIT but honestly this is way better and WAY cheaper. No doubt they are awesome watches, but for what I need it is just not the right tool for the job. Seems more of a item for people looking to prove something to other rich folk. Who knows, I may still get one :).  In short get this  you'll be happy you did!   http://fave.co/1bKVxeD

When I first heard of Henry & Me I thought this was just another venture for the Yankees to add to their already successful brand.  I was wrong.  This film is so much more than that as it &#34;tugged the strings&#34; and hit close to home as it would with millions of people around the world affected both directly and indirectly by illness.  However, by the end of the movie, I found that my melancholy emotions (as I have been affected, although indirectly, stricken with the same illness protagonist Jack is battling) were dwarfed by this films sense of adventure.  There is an intangible about this film that just makes me want to re-live my younger years as a Yankee fan and have the same strong aspirations as Jack.  This is a great film, for kids and adults alike, that teaches the invaluable lesson that know matter what hardships arise, with the right people by your side, you can choose to have the strength that makes you overcome.  One thing this movie lacked was more of my own personal favorite Yankees.  All in all, the message in this film was clear.

Okay. I was extremely skeptical of these little water-filled baggies of &#34;&#34;fake noodles&#34;&#34;.<br /><br />You should totally check this out:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BTMDALO/<br /><br /> I had read horror stories about the fishy odor and rubbery texture. As a low-carb junkie, I REALLY missed the sauces and meals associated with pasta. Enter the Miracle Noodle.<br /><br />Here's what I feel should be addressed:<br /><br />- THE SMELL. Maybe my sinuses are flared up worse than I realize, or maybe I'm at a genetic disadvantage with a lowered sense of smell. But whatever the case, I did NOT find the smell oh-so-offensive as others have described. I actually braced myself as I cut the pouch open the first time -- ready for the worst -- but I didn't smell anything until I literally put my nose an inch above the open bag. And I'd describe the smell as more of a &#34;&#34;brine&#34;&#34; than a &#34;&#34;fish&#34;&#34; odor. C'mon guys, it's not bad.<br /><br />- THE TEXTURE. I've found that the texture varies greatly on the preparation of the noodles. My first time eating them, I was rushed and starving... so I ate them straight out of the microwave tossed in pesto sauce. Not so great -- they were definitely rubbery this time. BUUUT, the SECOND time I prepared them, I made a creamy based sauce (melted 1 oz. cream cheese, 1 Tbs heavy cream, and 2 tsp. coconut oil, topped with some curry powder) and LET IT SIT for 2-3 minutes after preparing the dish. This way the sauce reeeally soaked into the noodles and gave them a softer and less-rubbery texture. Oh, and I just nuked them in the microwave this time, too. THIS time was good. Definitely a more &#34;&#34;noodle-like&#34;&#34; texture. I ate every last noodle!<br /><br />Also, some tips I've read are to microwave the noodles twice PRIOR to preparing them. By this, I mean: Open bag, rinse in warm water, microwave 2 minutes, rinse again, microwave for another 2 minutes, rinse one last time. At thispoint they're ready to prepare as desired.<br /><br />I'm pleased with my purchase, and I'd recommend these to people watching their glucose levels or anybody wanting a zero-carb option.

There are a lot of baby monitors on the market, but if you are searching for a baby monitor that will connect you with your baby regardless of your location, I'd highly recommend the iBaby M3s. I love how easy it is that I can set up the baby monitor. I didn't have to mess around with wi-fi or Bluetooth settings to get the monitor connected to my iPhone. Just paired my phone and the moitor with USB cable, and that's it. One of the best things I like about the unit is that I don't have to leave the app view on all the time at night, it will send me an alert when my baby is awake. It is a really useful feature. And the cherry on top, is that whenever the alert is sent to me, I also get a few pictures of my baby, so I know if my baby is really awake or it is just a false alarm.<br />However, just like any other baby monitors out there, this one is not without flaw. There is no iPad version of the iBaby View app. You have to manually switch to "iPhone Only" if you are using an ipad. And since the app is designed for iPhone, the image is stretched out on iPad's larger screen, so it's not as clear.<br />But overall, I believe that this is an amazing product, I would recommend it to all the parents of young babies.

I was really surprised what i learned after doing a little research about wheat grass i never knew how beneficial it really is. Since I started using it I noticed some very positive changes in my health. I have more energy and my digestive system certainly feels like it's more on track.

My family has had this wonderful grill for six weeks now and we've taken it camping twice. The first time we just cooked hot dogs on it, but the second time my husband did steaks, potatoes, veggies and even bbqed coconut, which I found tastes a bit like bacon.<br /><br />This grill is easy to pack along on a camping trip and once out of the bag it's easy to set up. The fact that it uses propane means that we don't have to use any charcoal and that's a big plus. If you're a camping family, like we are, I highly recommend this sturdy, little grill.

I've bought other toys for her since but her Octoplush is always right beside her in the crib whenever she goes to sleep and now she even dances a little bit when she hears the music! I assume she'll have it to enjoy for quite a few more years. It was a great buy and fairly inexpensive! A wonderful first toy for babies.

I initially sought these out due to the recommendation of my friend who is in the La Leche leage, and I have never been happier that I bought them! Best used with the (as seen in the picture)   http://fave.co/1bKRVJA  The fastener included on the pad is enough to keep you safe from any possible worry of movement. You just need to make sure that you place the fastener on the top side of your bra instead of on the bottom (I tried both). You can't even feel them on after the first day of adjusting... but the only thing I will say as a con is that you should be weary of what bra you use with them. I am using an all cloth, no shape/padding/wire nursing bra and 5 - 10% of the time you can see the bunched sides of the circular pad under the shirt. I think if I had a bra with more shaping to it, the pads would never show through.  I purchased 120 packs and still have yet to use half - and I'm in the third week post C-section delivery. I recommend these to anyone I know who is breastfeeding, pregnant, or looking for an answer for milk leaks. I have yet to experience a leak, or embarrassment, and I wear these every day and night. Also worth mentioning - they do stay in place. I haven't worried about these moving around at all.  Definitely a must have for new moms or an excellent gift item for anyone's shower if they breast feed or not. :)  I TOTALLY recommend getting   http://fave.co/1bKRZJ3

This was better than I expected it to be. It's obviously just Black Flag worked over a bit, but I enjoyed Shay Cormak quite a bit. I've missed Shaun and Rebecca in these last two forays into the DNA pool and I still haven't forgiven Ubisoft for bumping Desmond off the way they did. Maybe someone will find that Anka they were looking for and bring him back to life. Interesting to see old Haytham again. I still want to pinch his head off on sight. The sea battles were fun. The story was a bit .... I don't want to say lame, but it didn't keep you wrapped up in it like previous games. Plus it felt kinda weird rooting for the Templars. All in all...it was a fun game.

[[VIDEOID:5d451912139ed24fa80b889b0d6308f7]]My Toyota 4 cylinder vehicle with dead battery was left stranded for some works, I find the Gooloo product on Amazon, as a new brand, the price is cheaper,looks nice, so I decide to buy it and after three days I received it. It is relatively thin, almost as the mobile phone.  This work perfectly had to start my car no problems I jump the vehicles 5 times using it in consecutively,every time it done with no hesitation, and the unit still had 4 lights of battery level left.That is slightly batter than advertised.  In addition to jump start the car, it still has a few bonuses like the USB port and flash light. I could charge it from my cigarette lighter when I was on the road and start my motorcycle when i need it. So far I give it 4-5 stars for charge,  highly recommended. I hope after owning this product for a few months I still say it dose everything it's advertised to do and it great works.

I always want me to look so sexy. I bought this DarlingLove Women's Dreamgirl 3PC School Girl Costume medium size and it fits me so perfectly. It's 100% Polyester. I feel so comfortable when I wear it. This product is really so cheap but it doesn't look cheaply made. The quality of this product is great. This product ran true to size, and I didn't have to alter it to make it fit. You will be happy after you purchase this. And your boyfriend will be as well :) I would recommend it to who want to make her look sexy.

These guys are simply the best! There is no way I'm choosing any other brand over this. I have tried several leather bags companies, claiming to be original leather, but no! Everyone I have tried has either been a fraud and would deliver a very low quality, poor leather bag, or they were way too expensive. Before I found this awesome brand, I had completely lost my trust over these online bag selling companies. But Ecocraftworld has changed all that.  I can confidently say that these guys have won my trust. Their quality of leather is just out of this world. I use there wide range of bag collections for all purposes now. This bag in particular is the best one of them all. It's my personal favorite and I carry this almost everywhere I go. It's super stylish and has all the room I need for my papers, my tab and a huge mac.  I can easily recommend ecocraftworld's products to all my friends and family. And this one in specific! Go for it guys, you won't regret it.

Ever have those brief shining moments where something in your life goes right for once? The heavens part, and the light shines down on a 3am skeptical underwear purchase, and blesses you? These panties almost had me in tears earlier today. http://fave.co/1c3doht  So naturally, 5 minutes after putting them on, (and dancing around for a few minutes with my cats) I'm off to buy a handful of other packages of the same ones, in all sorts of different colors. Who knew it would take 30 years to finally nail the right kind of underwear! &#60;3 !!!  I bought them along with 2 other forms of &#34;boyshorts&#34; from different buyers. THESE are my salvation - the others were awful. I'm throwing them away, and don't even care - I was anxious because these are cute but ridiculously tiny in the packaging - but guess what, they stretch. and they keep stretching. And they hug your curves in all the right places, so flatteringly. And I look cute enough to run around in just my underwear again, now. I feel like one of those acrobatic yoga girls in the tampon commercials.  Not since I discovered these have I felt this good http://fave.co/1bKwbgG  I hope this review was helpful.

my opinion ukulele is suitable for adults and children, it's an instrument not only nice to learn. I like the color.It has four nylon strings that can protect children's finger being scratched instead of steel strings. It's compact size and authentic acoustic tone gives them a portable and timely performance characteristics, it is very suitable for the evening campfire, roadshow or any other similar occasions. I think anybody that purchases this would love it.The tuner works nicely--because this is a nylon stringed instrument,The painted fingerboards have accurately spaced, smooth and polished frets, while the guitar-style, geared tuners are more accurate than planetary-style tuners; effectively taking the guesswork out of tuning.<br />This product is amazing i will give 5 star.

This was a hilarious movie for both kids and adults. The animation was cleaner crisper compared to the first despicable me. The love for the minons by many is seen through this sequel as there are scenes that focus on the minions.<br />There are a few spots in the movie were it may seem a little dragged out, but those are minimal.<br />The ending will have you laughing constantly.

This thing works great. After a while you don't even notice it, but its there, watching, just in case. The mount also works great and has never fallen from the windshield. I don't think you can beat the features packed into this camera at this crazy price<br /><br />Loving it so far, does what it is advertised to do.<br />This camera takes full 1080p 30fps video which has surprisingly amazing quality and resolution when put on a computer or TV even compared to higher end cameras.<br />I like the capacitor model because there is no cheapo battery to go bad. So far the camera has held up in some extreme heat and direct sun with no issues.<br /><br />Good picture quality, records well and clear. Easy to use. I leave it up all the time in direct sunlight and it still functions normally. I read around before purchasing and this model seemed to be the best. Vision at night is ok but you can only really see what your headlights light up. I thought the screen was supposed to time out and cut off after a couple of minutes but that may have been another cam I was looking at while shopping around. It's not too bright to be a distraction though. The mount is good enough to set it and forget it but may be a problem if your constantly removing and replacing and not gentle. I give it 5 Stars. I'm satisfied. Still have not took it down. Works every time.

This seat warmer has done loads for my life on cold mornings when I'm headed out to work. It pulls in easily and heats up in no time. There really is no comfort like that of a warm seat when you have to wait around in traffic on what should be a 30 minute drive each morning. I always remember to unplug it before I head in for the day and if I'm cold on the way home, plug it right back in. Simple and painless.

Hardflip is an inspirational movie that teaches us that we can achieve anything just by slowly breaking all the obstacles standing in our way. Despite our circumstances, we are able to alone by solving our short term problems move to the highest peak of success ever. This is shown in Hardflip when Caleb a young skater is trying to become a sponsored skater, but recent problems such as his mother falling ill and his long absent father reappearing stand in his way like a dead end street. However the choices Caleb makes will decide whether or not these obstacles are the real issue. Realizing that no problem is great enough to prevent us from becoming who we are or want to be is the first lesson to understand.

The new bottle that I received is excellent! No issues at all, same beautiful design, and came with the same extra accessories. THE best infuser bottle that I have ever used. I am beyond satisfied with the service. Thank you!  I first gave this bottle a 3-star review when I received it. The bottle was wobbly (unstable when placed on a flat surface), and it was leaky. A representative contacted me through e-mail, concerned about my experience with the product. Apologizing and assuring that all of their bottles go through leak testing and quality control, he really wanted to see how the bottle was leaking. He kindly asked me if I can send him a video of the leaking bottle, and wanted to send me a new bottle. Once he saw the video of the bottle, he sincerely apologized over and over again and said this bottle should have never passed quality control. I received a defective bottle, and hey, it happens, and it happens all the time even with big companies. Not everyone and everything is perfect. I understand that as a small company, one defective product can impact the business and it can be very frustrating. I loved how this company handled this issue. They handled it like I would have handled my own business if I were the owner. They are very professional and I highly recommend them. Thanks again!

This drum kit is exactly what I needed to get started on the basics. What is really cool is the "Drums for Dummies" book that came with it, and I am learning like wildfire. I pretty much couldn't believe how simple it is when you understand the dynamics, thanks to the book. I spend a lot of time using the presets and play along with them. When my roomie gets tired of hearing the sound out of the box, I plug in my headsets and away I go without a problem. What a great way to spend time.

I got this for my grand daughter and my great grandson,  Miles so that she could see him in her back seat while she was driving.  She put it in the back seat on one of the side headrests and can now see everything he is doing, and can tell when he is happy or choking, or even when his pacifier falls out.  Its so big that she can see all around without having to twist her head in many positions.  This is actually a replacement for one that she had that did not have that swivel adjustment on the back, and she wasn't really able to adjust it. This one has a nice swivel ball that works great for aiming right at his face.<br /><br />It came in a nice box and was easy to assemble.  Nothing magic there but I can see this could be nicely wrapped as a shower gift if you wanted to use it as a gift like I did.  High quality.  Clear Mirror.  The only thing I didn't like is that it took a few moments to get the protective plastic off of the mirror before the first use.  Not really a big deal.

I just received my T440S. My Thinkpad X1 is getting old. I need another laptop and this one seems a perfect fit and a great deal. Everywhere I looked it costs $1100 or more. It is lighter than X1. The screen size is about the same. The look and feel is a little &#34;slicker&#34;. The touchpad is much larger. Yes it still has that famous red bottom. I love it. I rarely use the touchpad. The keys feel similar to X1. The touchpad feels somewhat different. It has almost all the accessories I need - 3 USB ports (instead of 2) and a SD slot. I think I'll end up using this T440S as my main computer and bump the X1 to a &#34;spare.&#34; This is only the first impressions. More user experience update later.

My kids don't like wearing sunscreen since they don't like their smell. This is the first sunscreen that they loved wearing it. They even ask for it when they are going to be outside. It has chocolate smell and also acts as a moisturizer. It is not at all greasy and is considered safe for children. Sometimes we adults also like using it. I thought because of high percentage of zinc, it would leave a white cast, but it appears clear.

Samsung makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class. I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. My friend has one one of these babies and I've gotta say, you haven't seen anything until you've seen that TV http://fave.co/1cwJN0j  Anyway, this TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).  Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.  One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage.  Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.  The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:  As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.  This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.  Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of this TV:  With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.  Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have. Pick yourself up a cheaper refurbished but still fully functioning TV! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R3E3FB2

After looking at the competition http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00L6TMHW8 and http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00KDJ4YXM  1. I love love love that the monitor is able to turn and I can basically see the whole room easily. I just need to swipe my finger on my phone screen. I don't need to adjust the monitor angle manually and then check where the viewfinder is, I can do it from anywhere in one second.  2. I still can't get over the fact that the audio in this device is two way! Not only I can hear my baby laugh and cry but I can also respond back and know that she can hear it well. Sometimes I can see her kind of starting to wake up and I talk to her softly and she goes back to sleep – without me needing to go to her room.  3. My husband does a lot of business travel and unfortunately misses a lot on the baby's milestones. With this monitor he can easily check on our babygirl when he is away. He says the quality of video is great even when he is so far.  4. The voice recording is just great! I can see a lot of potential for it when the baby gets older – I can record some bedtime stories and leave her listening to them and fall asleep by herself. Right now we use it to play lullabies of my husband singing. I play them for our daughter when he travels for work.  My husband and I opted for this baby monitor. We LOVE the new baby monitor! It has no delay in video. I haven't tried peep mode because I like too be able to see her at all times. It holds charge very well and for the people saying it doesn't I have found for it to get and keep fill charge it had too charge while it's off if it's running and your charging it it didn't take full charge.  People complaining about the light being bright are crazy cause its not bright at all and only blinks when there is noise in the room.  I can see her clearly in day our night vision!! The only thing I'm not sure about is the thermometer it said 75 I the room then I turned the fan on to cool the room and out said77 hmm..

I took this home from the store wondering if it was going to work, if I was going to get Netflix on my aging Sony Bravia and I have to say, I was worrying over nothing. Set up was about as hassle free as you can get. It took about three minutes and I was watching Netflix. Well, I wasn't watching exactly, I was checking to see if it worked and it did.<br /><br />I also checked out Hulu and was kind of bummed that regular Hulu wasn't included. You have to subscribe to Hulu Plus, which I guess I'm going to have to break down and do. Crackle, however, is still all free. Plus there are a lot of other channels I'll never watch, especially the news ones, because I have basic cable which gives me CNN, Fox and MSNBC, so I'm not really interested in the various news shows that are rerun.<br /><br />Netflix and Hulu on my five-year-old TV though, those are the main reasons I got Roku and it's delivering them to me in spades. Five big stars because this is just a wonderful device.

One word can describe it all, Perfect!.I am currently camping with my family and using this storage organizer right now. It has solid durability and compartment spacing is huge to get all your stuffs inside it, best thing i like is it can fit inside any car you have. When not in use it can be folded flat to keep it anywhere in compact space. The material quality is fantastic and its also waterproof, so no worries for spills and drops there. The other thing i like is, it comes with life time warranty which is a huge plus there for such a cheap price.

This is my favorite luggage because I travel almost every week for work and the size fits my needs. It's not too big but enough to accommodate stuff good for 4-5 days, which is my usual travel length. It's very lightweight but you can see the sturdiness inside out. I've already been using this for 2 years and it's still as good as new. It's very spacy and has complete support. Very easy to wash/clean and very easy to store because of the compact design. It rolls smoothly too. It never gave me any trouble so far.

Very high quality LED kit. I have work with lots of LED lighting and this kit is far superior to anything else out there. It also comes with everything that you need included! An assortment of different type fuse taps, more wire ties than you should ever need, alcohol wipes to clean the surfaces, mounting blocks with screws, again everything that you will need is in the box. Other companies charge you extra for many of those items.<br /><br />The kit comes with two installation methods. First is a very simple cigarette lighter method which if you can plug in a phone charger you can install this kit with ease. This method is also provides a very easy way to test your LED strips and control box functions before installation.<br /><br />The second method has you hard wire the control box to the fuse box. As mentioned earlier the kit comes with a very convenient fuse tap to accomplish this. You simply remove one of your existing fuses, plug in the tap just like it was the fuse and then reinstall the fuse you removed back into the tap.<br /><br />This kit also comes a door &#34;trigger&#34; wire that will automatically turn on the LED strips when you open a door. You can simply attach this to your dome lamp circuit which is usually located near the fuse box. I have mine connected this way and it works perfectly.<br /><br />LED strip installation, the strips are very high quality and very flexible. Each strip comes with about 5 inches of cable attached to it. This makes it nice when you are mounting them because your not having to fight with a bunch of excess wire. Then once you have it mounted you simply plug in the nice long extension cable. I have two lights under each side of the dash and two lights lighting the rear foot wells with plenty of extension cable left over.

The stand is not the best stand for the Flip if you shoot extended videos. It's good for short sessions. If the Flip needs to be angled, the stand doesn't hold that well and needs to be held with one hand to stay in place for handsfree recording. But the price makes it worthwhile for short videos.

As a backyard mechanic, I'm usually always out in the shop after dark or up really early to get a head start on the day's work. Since a big part of my business comes from tires, it's important to have a high quality tire guage that can stand up to any time of day or night. The LCD screen is bright and easy to read, and reads higher for those bigger tires that come in from farm equipment and such. I'm not having to switch between tools, either, because this guage can read psi and stuff like bar and kpa. Very impressed with the quality and &#34;extras&#34; that really make a great, handy tool to have.

I've owned, used and abused, several tripods in my life, but this is clearly the best, though not the lightest. Yes, it's a bit heavy, but it won't fall down and with the shoes that come with it you can shoot on a sandy or slicky beach, even put the tripod on rocks, if you have to to get the shot, without worrying too much, though I'd worry anyway, can't help myself.<br /><br />This is also my first Vanguard tripod and after having used it for awhile now, I don't know why I haven't had one before, because it's apparent to me now that Vanguard is a company with photographers on their mind.

I call this my baby. I say to my husband, "Honey, go get me my baby." I love this tool. It cuts through everything like it were a hot knife going through butter. The sliding arm lets you cut wide skirting boards. It angles beautifully. It is easy to adjust and then readjust repeatedly. It makes precise perfect cuts if you give it a good blade. It is perfectly portable. You can also bolt it down to your work bench but I have never felt the need as it is very steady. I just love this saw.

A bit pricey, but excellent quality. Made in Japan, so it's not just some cheap Chinese knock-off. The mic is very sensitive and the amplifier seems calibrated to accentuate voice frequencies specifically, though I can't be sure. Anyway, the voices come through pretty clear, at least through the brick wall I tried it on. Having the mic on a cord (about two feet) is great because you can just tape the microphone to the wall and not have to hold it tight against it all the time. Haven't tried recording yet, but should be possible to have it record to my laptop with the right connector. The outlet on the device is 3.5mm female plug, and so is the microphone plug on the laptop, so it would have to be a 3.5mm male to male cable...

I wanted something to wear on my surprise date with my husband that would grab his attention. This dress fit loosely but not too loose. I love how it exposed my back just enough to see my shoulder blades. And is just the perfect length to let his imagination wander. He loves this dress on me and now every time we go out he is like you’re going to wear that hot little dress that comes to mid-thigh and shows me your back. The quality of the dress is also amazing it is tightly and strongly stitched and care is easy if you follow the directions on the tag, It doesn’t lose its form or shape.

Great Product! It did remove all those stubborn dust on my image sensor. But do pay attention to different situations you are dealing with. Carefully check your test photo before cleaning and estimate where the dirty sports are. Highly recommend use a loupe to re-check these dirty sport on the sensor so you can tell if it is just dust that is easy to pick up or oil stain needs special attention. If you got oil stain, use a few swaps fully soaked with cleaner to dissolve the oil, and then quickly finish it with a dry swab.

I purchased the White model and it works great. the box came pretty beat up, but upon opening the box I noticed how well this item was packaged. The jack was in excellent shape and was aesthetically pleasing on my trailer. I sure do enjoyt the wireless remotes, they have great range and make it even easier to use! This jack has excellent power and is very quiet and smooth I would purchase this again in a heart beat.

Great leather duffle! The bag is huge and you can fit a lot of stuff into the bag. You will find a lot of room for all sort of different things one would want to take while traveling. I was pleasantly surprised by the separate compartments as described, and find separating items much easier. It's made with high quality material and is good looking both on the inside and outside. Just what I was looking for. Highly Recommended!

I own a sandwich shop and tried this digital frame to display my daily specials and loved the clarity of the screen so much that I chose to keep it on display. I have customers who always compliment how up to date I am with technology and all it took was this great frame! It was easy to load my files and really like that I could include the background music to add that extra touch! I definitely recommend this digital frame to all business owners!

I used this on a road trip from Maryland to Georgia and back. It went through rain, frost, and sun- worked like a dream! It is much larger than expected, which was great, we were able to pack luggage for 2 high maintenance women, 1 man and a baby entirely on top of the vehicle in this cargo bag on top of my Volkswagen Touareg. The babys bouncer was broken down and able to fit in the cargo bag as well. It allowed us to fit our dog in the vehicle and bring him on the trip- he wouldn't have fit otherwise!<br /><br />The bag did leak a little rain on the way down, but that was our fault for not securely fastening the velcro. On the way back, it did not allow any water to enter the bag. The best part (aside from the price- WOW!! What a deal!!) is that we were able to remove the bag from the top of the vehicle after the trip, fold it up and store it in the shed. A hard rooftop carrier would definitely not be as convenient.<br /><br />We used 2 Master Lock straps and the top of vehicle mat (to prevent paint scratches)- both purchased on Amazon in addition to the VW crossbars (from the dealership) to make this work. I could see it working without the crossbars with just the straps and vehicle mat- the bag and the 2 other items combined are less than $70. AWESOME.<br /><br />I am typically very conscious about the look of my vehicle, and from seeing photos online was still wary of the aesthetics. Once we secured the bag to the top of the vehicle, when full of our luggage, I will say it did not look bad at all.<br /><br />Overall- this bag deserves 5 stars for aesthetics, price, ease of use, size and storage capability!

A good coming of age movie, Liam James' Duncan reminded me in a way of the innocence of Patrick Fugit in "Almost Famous", an awkward kid who doesn't know how to connect to others yet, to be confident and to be himself. He finds a mentor in a part time job at a water park who can help 14-year-old Duncan become the man he should be, a good person on his own merits. Subtle and honest acting, particularly from Liam James, whose slight disconnection and disaffection could remind any of us of being a young teen again.

Let me clarify that I am not a teacher, I have never played more than six months when I was 5. So to some people I don't know everything. This is just a review on this product of what I have found. I was hesitant about ordering this product. From all the bad reviews and different people were complaining about odds and ends. I chose to get the Black Mendini 4/4 MV solid wood violin. Let me tell you a few things that I questioned that no one had posted about. The violin does come with the strings already put in place with the pegs. You have to insert your bridge and tighten the pegs so that the bridge isn't going to fall out or anything. One thing people complained about was the pegs slipping. All I had to do was push and twist so that it tightened into the wood on the other end of the peg. I have listened to a lot of violinist and heard a lot of tuning things. I was able to tune my violin by ear. At first when you are trying to tighten the pegs so your bridge will stay in place, you need to be careful not to break the strings. Especially your littlest and thinest string. You have to move slowly and carefully. The rosin that came with mine was cracked and flakey. But you have to scratch it up a little bit to make it powdery anyways. If you take it straight out and try to play it you will get the worst sound. You need the rosin on the bow. and quiet a bit at first or you will get a cracky sound. Last night I was able to learn how to hold the bow, was able to play my open strings. and also learned the rest of the notes down the neck. The only thing I am worried about is I have already had two hairs fall out of my bow. I will see how it does over the next few weeks. If it loses to much then I will contact the seller since it is under warranty. I haven't tried out the shoulder rest yet. But if I do I will be sure to come back and update if it is good or bad like some people have said. Also Some people complained about the body being in bad shape, or the neck being crooked. Mine looks perfect. My neck is straight, and there isn't any buffs or marks or scratches anywhere. I am hoping for luck since I am 23 now and learning to play. I think I have a great start, It takes a lot of determination to get it all down!! Overall I would say this is a great beginners violin especially when you don't have 300 or more to put down on a violin that you may not continue to play! I do enjoy it though I feel I will be purchasing something better in the future!

Wanted a TV to use as a computer monitor as well. I knew this model does not have a VGA connector, but already decided to use a HDMI connection to system anyway. Honestly got a little set back when I seen screws for connection of the stand. But after a very easy install, realized why, as this stops the usual inherit wopple to get with most small screen stands. As far as the picture, the presets are easy to find and test which you prefer. As to the display, it's clear crisp, sharp.

My husband has started a collection of good looking watches that do not cost a lot, most are under a $100.00. The ones from Stuhrling include  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00B2GZJXE   and   http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00B2GZHP4  To me it has an old fashioned look about it. The price was great, although I really do not believe the original price being that hig. I think that some of the watches on Amazon might be older models, but who cares when you get a watch that looks great and is cheap enough and works great also.  Stuhrling watches are noted for their large size and this is one is fairly big. The three bands are a great extra and easy to replace. The watch has a stunning dial face design.

The three videos in this set cover instruction from very basic beginning workouts, which are also modified to advanced and challenging versions of pilates, with a good selection of items in between in terms of difficulty and time.<br /><br />Depending on how in shape you are you may be able to get through the real basics on Inflexible quickly, though for technique and form it is a good starting place.  Same for the beginning level on weight loss.  But then there is still the middle and challenge sections on weight loss and all the sculpt video.

I just bought this one firstly because of the many positive reviews I've seen so far, the kit was delivered 2 days after I ordered it, and because of the unprofessional work of a car wash shop near our area where I let them car wash our 2008 Honda accord but after 2 weeks, it became clouded again.<br /><br />So for the results, it was superb, I managed to make our headlight clear and new looking after 20 minutes with the help of the guide/instruction within the product. Though at first I'm doubting and a bit scared because its my first time doing it and what should I do if I wrecked our headlight, but it felt good in the end when I saw the good results.

I'm impressed, this is a great off road light bar, Nado Stuff ship this lights bar by express and speed delivery.<br />it is so bright can not use in the city street only for off road use.<br />The unit puts out so much light that the area right around the buggy are lit up just fine. Out 200 yards is a 100 foot shiny spot light. Animal eyes can be seen for 150s of yards. Speed limit signs are so bright when you pass them you have to look away.<br /><br />The aluminum housings with integrated heat sink seem to be well made and tough, and do a good job of dissipating the heat the four 3 watt Cree LEDs generate. They have survived being completely in a heavy rain for a period of time, and have now also survived an extensive four hour downpour out on the trail, so I believe they will be durable long haul.<br /><br />I highly recommend this MICTUNING brand Curved light bar! will no doubt to buy again!

If you are a cheapskate like me then you wash your own car, or get the children to do it to earn some pocket money. Well my wife picked me up some of these towels from the hardware store and they are fantastic.<br /><br />These towels don't just soak up water they draw it towards them, you really must see it to believe it. They also absorb so much more water than normal towels and don't leave a single streak.<br /><br />The towels are just about big enough at 22 inches by 30 inches and I think they would benefit from being a bit on the larger side, however, other than that they are great.

WOW. The Smith&Stanley Car Escape Tool really does beat all the budget tools out there! This really is a quality product. Yes, it does cost a little bit more, but for a tool that could possibly save your life, I certainly don't have any issues in spending on this tool which works out to be less money than the price of a tank of fuel. And this tool could actually end up saving my life, and whomever I buy it for. This is simply a tool that does its job. It slices the belt faultlessly, and smashes glass effortlessly. I tested it. I figured that a tool like this can't be left to see if it works or not until I'm in an emergency situation. I noticed that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews of the other tools are given by buyers who haven't tested the tool. Whilst the negative 1 star poor reviews are given by buyers who've actually tried it out and didn't find what they expected! Yikes! That was a real worry to me. What I like about this tool is that it has the right materials to do the job – an extremely sharp Titanium blade and a really tough head made of hardened Carbon steel. I looked into this more and found that to break toughened glass you'll need at least something like hardened carbon steel. However, budget tools are mostly made from softer steel. I've tested these and they're pretty useless! Just have a look on YouTube and you'll see people struggling with them. This tool, unlike others, is also approved, tested, and certified by TUV – I haven't seen this in many tools like this. The certifications and approvals it comes with are certainly worth it in terms of peace of mind knowing that what you've bought has already been approved that it can do its job. I don't know about you, but for me that's a simple check. In summary, I'm very glad I got this tool, and I'm happy to recommend it. However, I would say that before buying yours, check that it can do the job. For a life-saving tool, I really don't think cheap is necessarily thebest option??? Hope that helps and informs.

I am really particular about what towels I use on my car, mostly because I had a really bad experience once with a horrible cloth and a beautiful car... it wasn't pretty. So when I bought this I was really careful at first, but it turns out my worries were for nothing! This towel is incredible and does the best job of any drying towel I've tried! It dries my car really fast, and it doesn't leave any lint or streaks! Plus we've actually used it in a few places inside the house and it does a great job here as well! These cloths are definitely worth a try for any car!

This is a lovingly researched and professionally edited 2 DVD set giving the ultimate overview of the life and career of the great Leonard Cohen. Unlike many of these type programs this one DOES have plenty of LC's music and performance footage, and even some LC interviews (albeit archive ones)  If you aren't ever going to get around to reading one of the breeze-block sized biographies (none of which, as far as I'm aware are sanctioned or have any contribution from Leonard himself) then this will do the job nicely. And if you have read everything, time to get a little less academic less and chill out in front of the this very decent 3.5 hour documentary.

This series has everything on it. A great story of scheming and vengeance coupled with historical facts. It has blood and gore which is rarely shown in any series out there today. There is also nudity, there is nothing else you can ask for!<br /><br />The best thing about the series is that they keep on improving their effects. In first season, you could clearly see the fake blood but now, I keep on thinking, how do they do it? It's just that good.<br /><br />There is no series close to what Spartacus has brought into the table. The closest is probably Game of Thrones but Spartacus was the first so you might say it just copied the way Spartacus was going.

I was looking for a cheap side table for the couch that wasn't a full size end table and this worked perfectly. It is exactly the same height as my IKEA couch and is sturdy especially because of the lower shelf. It has no drawers and the shelf cannot be moved so it may not meet everyone's expectations. The product does not look like cheap laminated wood so for the price I think it is a good deal.

by Bill Chambers Paramount brings The Wolf of Wall Street home in a bare-bones release that, as anticipated by all but a few chumps, does not contain any deleted scenes or additional footage incorporated into the body of the film. I'm sure Hell will freeze over before Scorsese restores this or Gangs of New York to their original length, though his availing deleted scenes to the public is not unprecedented, as the Cape Fear DVD and Blu-ray demonstrate, so maybe we haven't seen the last of this movie yet. At least the dearth of frills grants the 2.40:1, 1080p transfer of the film itself a generous 42GB berth, and the resulting image is above reproach. Practically a Star Wars prequel in its use of digitally-generated environments, and shot in a mix of Super35--sometimes with anamorphic lenses, for the focal distortions--and HD (the ARRI Alexa was reserved for low-light and greenscreen-heavy shots) by Argo DP Rodrigo Prieto, The Wolf of Wall Street nonetheless boasts a cohesive, credible, and cinematic Blu-ray presentation with glassy detail and supple dynamic range. Grain is extremely subtle, but any noise-reduction was surely done at the intermediate stage rather than after the fact, while an emphatic ruddiness to the skin tones seems to be a Scorsese signature of late (see: Shutter Island). Other than size, this is an insignificant downgrade from a DCP screening. The attendant 5.1 DTS-HD MA track is a 360° wall of sound whenever the offices of Stratton Oakmont erupt in mayhem, although dialogue is always very clear above the fray, including much throwaway ADR. Song reproduction, critical to a Scorsese mix-tape such as this, is excellent, crisp and full.<br /><br />Perfect I think they could cut running time down by half hour.<br />The time flew by watching this movie!

I  write this and threw it out because I think you would like to have something that can actually start your car, not just charge your phone. as long as your vehicle doesn't have a large engine/diesel, it'll start it, although it so thin.<br /><br />I work for a company, and while they provide jump packs for us, often a Jump-N-Carry 660 or something similar, sometimes they would end up being a little low on juice. So I figured I would buy a jump pack for myself.<br /><br />The largest engine I can remember starting was a 3.0L that was in a passat that had a drained battery. So for occasionally starting most vehicles, this will do just fine. Though starting vehicles in the winter is more difficult I imagine it'll still be able to start the same ones it can now, though I'll try to update this review during the winter.

This is the best final fantasy since FFX. The graphics are good. The characters themselves are brilliant the enviroments are well done. Yes a lot of the none important characters have psp graphics with HD gloss but tbh it doesn't matter they have so little screen time.  This is a war story with politics, backstabbing, and requires the player to have some intelligence with regards to how wars were fought. i.e WW1 and WW2. No I'm not saying go read them and you'll understand Type 0 but a lot of what people are saying is confusing just makes me laugh at their stupidity.  The Story Is brilliant: Let me just say this. If you don't get the story (As I've found it very very easy to follow) your stupid. Drop the game and go play hello kitty.  The amount of content in here, and the fact that it was originally a PSP title, it blows my mind. Awesome storyline, fun combat, and a great cast of characters. It's a must buy for any FF fan and anyone who wants to try out a fun action JRPG. True fan with the cash, can pick up one of the bundles like this one: http://fave.co/1bKMyKr  Trust me if you are a FF fan or Fan of FFX and FFVII your going to completely love this game.  What I can't understand is characters I find so funny like nine are being called annoying. Guys stop trying to find the reason of life in FF go outside get a life and stop taking it so seriously.  As for the critics reviews they are dead wrong and they will live to regret it. Look at destiny they did they stupid &#34;We've taken a few classes in good story writing and read some books there fore we know what we're talking about&#34; **** Gave the game a terrible score and it won a bafta.  How many hours have I played 22 hours yes. And what's amazing is that all 14 characters feel OP they all so good. I can hardly (acutally I can't) find a bad team make up. The character design is just amazing.  The reviewing industry is in shambles and the fact that this game is 74 on metacritc just proves it. It should have universial acclaim.  Look SE well done with this game it's amazing and thank you for giving me another real FF game  In the end if you're not at least checking this game out, your'e missing out! http://fave.co/1bKMGcQ

My fiancée bought me this ring as our engagement ring. The proposal was a bit of disappointment. He wanted to put it on the saucer so when I will be asking for a sauce, I would see it and I will be surprise. Yet the ring was served on a wrong table and the one in there got mad because of the ring. My fiancée ran on the table and grabbed it. He gave it to me with frustration and asked me if i will marry him with a frustrated face. I got mad and told him to ask me again on a good way. He shouted, &#34;Mary, you are my life, my everything. I don't think I will be able to live another second without you beside me when i am going to sleep and if i can't see your face when I wake up. Can you please share a lifetime with me?&#34; Everyone was shocked and touched by what he said. Who am i to say no, right. This is such a great ring by the way. The best ring for me. :)

I have spent the last 12 months trying to find a 28 inch TV for my small home gym. Basically I want to be able to watch Netflix, Amazon Instant Video and other internet based video offerings on this TV. I began this quest with the predecessor to this TV, the<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B009IBXEE6<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Picture: WOW, just an amazing, clear, bright picture. Yes I know it's 720p vs 1080p but it doesn't matter to me.... it looks better to me than the Samsung which was a 1080p. Blacks are black. Motion is handled well. The edges are the same as the center near as I can tell. It has different video modes (game, vivid, etc) so you can set it how you want it. Note that the factory default is energy saving and they recommend other video modes for the best picture. And speaking of energy savings, the rating says this uses $7 a year, down from $9 last year.<br />- Sound: VERY decent. Note I'm not going to say this is surround sound with big bass and Captain Kirk whizzing by your head. For that you need an external sound system. But the tinny AM-radio sound of prior year's models is replaced by very very decent sound. There also different sound modes in the settings area to allow you to customize. Sound and picture are very subjective but I'm happy with both and I sure wasn't with my other two Vizio's. (The first Vizio I added a sound bar, the second Vizio I returned for the disastrous Samsung model mentioned above).<br />- Set up / etc: This TV is significantly lighter than last year's model. And the narrow bezel means that basically it's almost ALL Screen you're looking at... you don't even notice the very small frame around it. Even the box this comes in is smaller than the 32&#34; Saumsung box ( I still have it so I can return that model ) and the 32&#34; box from the Vizio last year. Literally I can lift this TV with one hand -- it's that light. It was a pleasure to install. Speaking of installation, you turn it on and it immediately guides youthrough a few basic questions (language, how to you get your TV service), it scans some channels and then BAM it's up and running. The Samsung spent almost an hour scanning channels (this TV is plugged into digital cable directly so it only gets 1 free channel) and then another 20 minutes deleting the scrambled ones. The set up on this is very intuitive and FAST.<br />- The remote. This is the same as least year's remote. No back light. No big buttons. But you know what, I like it. My Samsung remote had a backlight and looked like a 1990s-era cell phone, 12 inches long and tons of buttons that I never used. Yet it was missing a few things this remote has, namely hot key buttons to go straight to Netflix, M-Go and Amazon video. I love those buttons. Also this remote is light, easy to hold, and when it falls it is sturdy (yep, already dropped it on a hard floor, no damage). Even though the buttons are small, they are logically laid out and I found myself not looking down after a few minutes of using it.<br />- Screen mirroring (sort of..): New for 2014 is what Vizio is calling &#34;Second Screen Interactivity&#34; which means that supported apps (right now it's just Netflix and Youtube) allow you to stream videos to the TV similar to Apple's Airplay functionality. You see a little icon on the screen as you are playing a video in one of these apps and it then plays on your TV. Right now this is limited to just those two apps and does not work with videos stored on your ios device or with other apps (e.g. Amazon Instant video app). I have only tested this on the iPhone but Vizio's materials say this also works on Android devices. I hope more apps take advantage of this feature in the future.<br />- Online user manual: Normally I don't get excited about an online user manual but this one is clear and easy to navigate. 62 pages long.<br /><br />The cons:<br />- As of this writing, when you go to the Amazon Instant Video app you get this message: &#34;The Amazon Instant Video application is currently unavailable while we are working hard to bring you an updated, feature rich application. For more details, visit amazon.com/videohelp&#34; I'm guessing / hoping this will be fixed soon, but not too cool to ship a TV with an Amazon button where Amazon doesn't work. I spoke with Vizio (great customer service via phone by the way, short hold times and good representative) and they said that Amazon is updating the app to comply with FCC requirements around closed captioning. I spoke with Amazon and they said they are working on the app but have no date of resolution. So for now, no Amazon Instant video on this TV. I PROMISE that when they fix this bug I will come back and put an update RIGHT HERE.<br />- DLNA sharing. As you might know, DLNA is a standard which allows media devices on the same home network to &#34;see&#34; each other and exchange files. So for example, this TV uses DLNA to see my movies I have stored on my computer. While Vizio gets a plus for the TV immediately seeing the rest of the network and being able to browse files on my computer, it gets a big negative for not being able to play video files that my Roku can. It was able to play some .avi files but struggled with .mp4 and .mpg files. In some cases it displayed a message that the &#34;codec is not supported&#34; and in others it just ignored &#34;play&#34; commands. I tried using my PlayOn server to see if the encoding that Playon performs would help this TV play the aforementioned files. Nope. In this area Samsung was stronger and Roku is still the best at being able to play anything you throw at it.<br />- No web browser. Most of the Smart TV's I've used have rudimentary browers. I haven't found on one here so far. I wouldn't use my TV to browse the web but some might be looking for that feature. I will keep looking for it and will update this review if I find one but a Google search indicates this is a long-standing yet unfulfilled feature request.<br />- No update feature. I assume this TV downloads updates but I've searched all over the menus and I cannot find an &#34;update now&#34; feature for firmware or apps. This might be a plus if it's all seamlessly automatic in the background.<br /><br />That's it. This is a phenomenal TV at a great price. Vizio has come a long way from last year's model in picture quality and especially sound. I recommend you get the http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SMBETXS

The Armoire arrived quickly and was a breeze to put together. It did have a small nick in the wood, however it was in the back where you can't see it. I love the way it looks, see 5 stars for appearance. I gave it a 4 for durability due to the drawers; they look great, however, you have to be very careful when pulling them open to get your jewelry because the drawers fall out very easily.

I have learned my lesson over the years, so from here on out I only purchase the best batteries for my cars whether my daily driven one or my classic corvette that I take to the shows. Optima seems to be the best I could find.<br /><br />Tip: If you have a car that sits for long periods of time over the winter, make sure you hook it up to a smart charger. I personally use the [[ASIN:B004LWVEKS NOCO Genius G3500 6V/12V 3.5A Automatic Multi-Purpose Battery Charger and Maintainer (Grey)]] but there are other brands out there too.

I have used various types of wash mitts over these years, but all of them felt a bit slippery inside after some time and became harder to hold with my hands. After reading number of reviews on amazon, I decided to purchase wash mitts from Crusar due to their good elastic wrists and pretty good size. I was really impressed with their shipping timings and nice packaging. These wash mitts are perfectly fit for my hands. These microfiber mitten has longer fibre fingers and therefore has more ability to absorb waters.  These mitts are also great for other purposes like dusting of delicate objects, electronics and even soaking wet dogs after a bath. Overall, the products are very good so far and worth caring for. I would surely like to recommend for all washing and drying purpose.

To start with, my copy of this DVD plays perfectly so the reviewer who has complained his copy doesn't appears to have a faulty disc and should merely send it back for a replacement.<br /><br />The documentary is a very interesting trawl through the band's history from their first album to the point in the early 1980s when they hit the very top of the Rock music ladder and were without doubt the biggest band on the planet. Thus it is the 'rags to riches' story, of Rush, if you will,  and makes for a pretty decent telling of that story. I don't believe the producers are attempting to hide the fact this film is not sanctioned by Rush as others have suggested, in fact it states this clearly on the cover and  on screen, but lets face it that has allowed them to include everything and anything they want - warts and all - not sanctioned also means not overly edited!. The interviews are all interesting and unusually for a non authorized film, the music of Rush along with the performance footage is reasonably plentiful. Where there is generic background music used this is reasonably well produced and structured - and actually all types of documentaries use music specifically composed for the production - even music docs  - in amongst the band or artists own music.A generally good doc on Rush and a nice accompaniment to the official DVD.

Loved it. I grew up reading comic books, as a kid the campiness worked, the PG feeling made sense. I still love comic books and comic book movies, but I no longer want the camp and the tackiness that comes with them. DC and Marvel have done a great job scaling it down, but out of the two, DC takes the cake. Assault on Arkham is a great example of that. Bad guys, killers, psychos going into an Asylum, you have to expect hard language, sexuality and violence, and the movie delivers. I hope DC continues this pattern.

I am completely agree with the subject-matter of this film. The 3D effects are prominently excellent, I get the chance to feel many 3D effect in contrast with other films wherein we can see the 3D moments so poorly or absolutely not. This film give the feel for me that the animals almost come out from the screen, they are looking so powerful and realistic. I think the story of this document movie is really exciting and comparable wiht other films in this topic. The sound quality is DTS-HD 5.1 master audio which guarantee an extremely super sounding whereby this soundtrack is even more better. I could order this 3D film from the UK but the postage rates were really high so I would offer for everyone to order it from the amazon.com to save a lot of money. I use the following main equipments to watch this blue ray: LG Cinema Screen 47LM7600 , LG BH9420PW 1080W 3D Blu-ray Home Theater System.

My son was interesting in picking up the guitar, and since he's often 'interested' in a lot of things, I thought this cheap start up pack would be a good start.  39 inches is a good size for a child it seems, and, actually, the maple wood fret board and bridge look a lot nicer than I would have expected.  This kit was really all I needed to buy for him, since it came with all the start-up accessories, too.  We'll just have to see if he stick with it...

I bought this item a few weeks ago. Standard shipping took only a few days. Battery performs much better than the factory model from Dell. I followed instructions included with the battery in order to "calibrate" it. It just involves charging fully and discharging fully 4 or 5 times. My new battery now lasts for close to 4 hours with minimal use (internet browsing and word processing). I'm very happy with the product so far. Not sure about the perfomance of this battery long-term, but my Dell is already more than 5 years old. I plan to replace it soon anyway. For the price, this battery was an excellent purchase.

Let me start off by saying I own a set of Astro A50s, Triton Ax Pros, and Turtle Beach DPX21s. All top of the line head sets for sure. But for the money these are second to none. Now granted they don't have that full dolby surround sound where you can literally close your eyes and tell what direction the sound is coming from like the before mentioned headsets. For a stereo two channel headset they come pretty darn close. Sounds are loud, crisp, and clear. Comfort is amazing. And the simplicity of hooking them up with the wireless usb adapter is a major plus. Tried them on the vita with the included cable jack and they did not disappoint either.<br />Also with the headset app which can be downloaded from the PS store you can customize the bass, mid, and treble level. Or you can choose from the different presets available as well. Take it from someone who has owned numerous headsets, both stereo and dolby digital. For a $100 you won't find a better set on the market right now.

This video was simplistic and intriguing, but definitely left me wanting more. The highlights were the anatomical presentations of female genitalia and the demonstration of DOing. Those segments were especially well communicated, and together, provided a great foundation to understanding deliberate orgasm. Although the video seemed to be a bit outdated, with color schemes and transitions that were reminiscent of a powerpoint presentation, the uniqueness of the demonstration portion of the video still grasped my attention. Despite its video quality, the content of the video is extremely valuable and is something I look forward to sharing with people close to me.

Bird on a Wire isn't a movie that immediately springs to mind when thinking about classic movies from the 1980s.  But personally, I love it.  it came out right as the action comedy genre was starting to become popular, and this is one of the finer efforts.  Basically, take Mel Gibson's Lethal weapon, replace Danny Glover with Goldie Hawn, add A LOT more comedy and reduce the action sequences (though there are still some of those), and you have Bird on a Wire.  Not to say that there isn't action in the movie, because there is.  But this action-comedy definitely emphasizes the latter and not the former.  It's a really good one.

I need a flashlight for my job, and this one is exactly what I needed. First, it is heavy and solid enough. When you use the extension tube and have put in three 26650 batteries, it feels like you are holding a baton in your hand, which gives you a sense of safety. Second, it is very bright. I live in the countryside. This flashlight can light up things within one hundred meters. Even the leaves on the trees can be clearly seen. That is really amazing. Third, I was worried about the quality of the batteries at first, but after using it on a daily basis, I found that its own 26650 batteries last for over two hours in highlight mode. This saves me a lot of bother, for example, always having to charge or take another set of batteries. I have really high demands, but I have to praise the fashionable and simple case, which suits my taste well. It could easily be given as a gift. I'd like to give it 5 stars .

I got this band to replace the factory band on my luminox 3083. I kept having issues with the end of the factory band pulling loose, plus it just looked cheap compared to the watch. Well worth the upgrade. This band is much more secure and has a classier look. It looks like a nice steel band you'd expect on a dressier watch, but it's still lightweight and matches the case of the luminox. Each link of the band is held in place with a small screw, which I prefer to the springloaded pins (those always seem to launch away from me never to be seen again). Takes more tools to disassemble than pins I guess, but that wasn't an issue for me. Some reviewers complained about the screws working themselves loose...I haven't had this issue, but I would imagine that if you were worried about it, you could put a drop of loctite on the screws before reassembling the band back together

Sitting all day is incredibly unhealthy and I noticed this when I started working at home.

When I found out that sitting was causing it, I got this and it solved all of my problems.<br /><br />The first week was a little hard since my body wasn't used to it, but by the second week, I was a lot more productive. I also felt much healthier than before and I haven't been sick since!

I picked the Casio AE1000W as a cheap beater watch for traveling and work and it's performed admirably given the price I paid. I've owned it for a year. It is a fairly large watch with a resin band so it may feel a little odd if you have slender wrists, but it is very lightweight. The current watch face does have a few small scratches over the course of my time using it but they're not particularly bad and everything else has held up well. It's done fine given that this is essentially my beater watch.<br /><br />The World Time features are nice and easy to use. You can select 5 time zones as your most frequent time zones for the primary timekeeping mode and then easily change the main time zone out as needed. It's particularly nice because you can easily turn DST on or off for any one time zone. It's also been holding time quite well.<br /><br />The 5 alarms are useful - They can be set to be single use or recurring which makes them nice for simple reminders or as a backup wake-up alarm (although it's a little quiet if you're a heavy sleeper). The digital timer is a very useful feature and the stopwatch works as advertised.<br /><br />The analog face is a little pointless in that it's extremely difficult to read compared to a true analog watch. The center dot is extremely large compared to the size of the face's hand segments. It's more of a novelty, but it does allow you to see the time in your primary time zone in all modes (including the stopwatch or timer mode) so it's useful in that respect. The Light is an orange/amber colored LED that illuminates the time from the side of the face rather than evenly throughout the entire face of the watch. It works fine, regardless.<br /><br />Need a cheap watch with plenty of features? It's not terribly slim, but it's got that great intersection of price and plenty of features that it's hard not to recommend.

Bought these to repair the soles on my work boots. I bought some contact cement. I glued the souls on, trimmed them to size right away and only clamped at the toe for 10 minutes. Removed the clamp and slipped the boots on and went to work. I work on a farm and it rained hard the same day and they held with no issues. Been a week now and they are still good to go wearing them daily. These are good quality souls and should last a long time.<br />Highly recommended soles.<br />I plan on ordering another set for my riding boots.

This is exactly what my daughter was looking for. It is very light weight and it has a great sound. I'm very impressed with the build quality, so check out other reviews for the sound quality but know that this is a high quality build. I would recommend this for anyone looking to do amateur voice recording.

I use this sound system for Irish Dance performances, parades, and dance parties. The sound quality is perfect for small to mid size venues. It is lighter than my previous system, and I love the built in handle and wheels. I haven't had to use it to the fullest extent of it's charge (several hours). but so far, it has gone over 3 hours and barely drops on the charge meter. For my use, I appreciate the usb mounts so I can charge my iPod during shows rather than in the car on the way to the next venue. Also, I haven't used the blue tooth technology yet for my purposes. I highly recommend this system.

This is a handy, well designed portable luggage scale.  It has a nice finish of chrome with a window that shows the weight of the luggage hanging below.  The window that shows the weight is offset so that you can hold the handle with luggage below and still read the weight.  The strap is a good length so that you can hold the luggage at a relatively normal height while weighing it.<br />The unit measures in g, Kg and pounds so it can be used internationally.  It is also useful for weighing any small or medium weight object that you may need to weigh if you can attach the object to the scale.  This is a good value and I recommend the luggage scale.

I actually bought three of these at once, so that I could hook up my XLR mics in my home studio. I am a sound engineer for one band, and we go through cables in a hurry. I have done my share of repairs on cables and wanted to see the guts and stripped one down. The ends are soldered like they should be. I am always in a need of new hardware like this that is a very high quality, and an even better deal! Unless some fool cuts it in half i don't expect any trouble.

So I bought this headphone amp about a year ago and I can say its prity well made and nice to have when working with alot of audio equipment. Alot of the time I have it hooked up to my computer becouse it gives me realy quick controll of the volume going to my speakers or headphones. It Gives me 4 outputes, all with there own volume controls. Its case is made of metal so its pritty rugged. The sound is graet, I never even have to max out the volume on it. I never seem to lose any sound quality. It uses 1/4" stereo jacks, wich is no problem for me cus I always use my vintage headphones. I ordered converters for other headphones and audio equipment I sometimes use. I would prob advise using some velcro if you are going to have it in one spot all the time cus it slides easly. Its nice and small but has to be plugged into the wall so you cant realy use it on the go. Over all it was well worth the money.

Though I am disappointed at the fact that Samsung would not provide this with such an expensive TV that we purchased, the product in and of itself works great. It's a simply set up process, the range is good (it is probably over 40 ft away from the router), and it has had no hiccups so far. We didn't have enough space around the TV to put an Apple TV or a Wii, so this works great to stream directly onto the TV. Going in at the back, it is not even visible from the front. Completely unobtrusive!

I needed something different than my http://fave.co/1bA46bU  So I got this http://fave.co/1bPP7LH  I was able to use these diamond bits to make holes in old bottles, so we can use them for decor lights. These bits served my purpose very well. Diamond drill bits are much much better than the carbide spade bits. Now the drilling is faster and I don't break any more bottles. I use running water to keep the bit cool, and each bit lasts up to 20 bottles (depends on the bottle obviously). I say, this is a good deal based on the price.  I am a pretty novice DIY homeowner. And the project I had was installation of a reverse osmosis faucet. I purchased this set to drill a hole in my precision granite countertop. As a first timer, I took my time with the hole saw and tried my best to keep the tip of the tool cool. It tool me almost 45 minutes to go through the 1 inch thick granite but if I did it again, I can do it faster. This is a useful set of tools and the price is less than what I am willing to pay for one single hole saw.

I received my order and was happy with the company packaging. The Multipurpose Laser Level Horizon Vertical Metric Rulers are worth the price. This product can be used for up to 8 feet, standard and adjustable. It gives accuracy due to the laser light beam. This feature reduce parallax errors and that gives it more advantage over similar product which never consider this factor. The fact that it gives my horizontal and vertical measurements perfect alignments, I recommend it to anyone. Handling it is simple and the black color is preferably as it does not fade easily. For the additional batteries included, thank a lot for that. They are the long lasting type and it seems that I will not be buying others soon. After successful purchasing and using this tool, I think I will order several of them and resell at my workshop. I think my customers will not be disappointed as I have tested all its aspects.

I bought these gloves to use while I was seasoning my cast iron skillet.  Handling cast iron after 15 minutes at 200 degrees: - No perceived sensation of heat through the gloves while maintain a constant grip for about 2 minutes  Handling cast iron after 2 hours at 400 degrees: - No perceived sensation of heat at first contact between gloved hand and iron handle - Sensation of heat with no discomfort first perceived after a 15 seconds with a constant grip  After two hours at 400 degrees, I picked up the very hot cast iron skillet expecting to feel some heat through the gloves but I felt nothing. I was so impressed I kept my grip on the hot iron handle to see how much longer before I felt anything. I began to notice the sensation of heat at about 15 to 20 seconds. I did not maintain my grip after that and set the pan down. I didn't think it wise to maintain prolonged contact with such a hot piece of iron regardless of how effective of a heat protectant this glove may be. I noticed some heat but absolutely no discomfort. I highly recommend this product.

I'm currently using this with the Playstation 4 and playing Destiny.  If you haven't already looked at this you should: http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00KSQAACO/   The headset is very light and fits nicely on my head. It was easy to get it working with the PS4. You have to plug the USB wireless transmitter into the USB port on the PS4 and connect the optical cable from the USB stick to the optical port in the back of the PS4.  You'll also have to attach the mic to the headset to use the chat function.   The optical cable is only long enough to reach from the USB port to the back of the PS4. You will not get audio if you do not connect the optical cable from the stick to the PS4. You can use the headset to chat with just the USB transmitter, but no game audio will output without the optical cable connected. (without the optical cable plugged in, you might as well just use the included mic plugged into the controller).  You will also need to adjust the audio and chat settings at the settings menu on the PS4 to get it working. It is not automatic.  While playing Destiny, I was able to hear birds chirping and the wind blowing while in the tower. Everything sounded like it was around me. I heard small sounds through the headset I never noticed compared to just just outputting the audio to my TV. All the gunfire had great bass, and the enemy screeching and screaming came through clearly. It really does sound amazing.  The headset also does an amazing job of canceling out background noise. While wearing the headset, I could only hear my friends talking and the audio in game. The only time I heard anything while wearing these is when my dog barked.  The headset comes paired right out of the box, and it only needed a 30 minute charge to get it to full power when I received it. I plugged it into the USB port on the PS4 to charge while playing Destiny.  I also enjoy wearing these while playing because I have a little baby and I can play the game (minus the chatting, of course) while he is sleeping. They sound pretty loud when you are wearing them, but people around you won't really be able to hear the audio from your headset.  you can also use this with your iPad or Phone but since you need the 3.5 mm cable to plug into the jack, it is kind of cumbersome. I don't even bother with it. This was meant for gaming on the PS4.  There are also preset settings, but I did not find them to make a difference. They all sounded the same to me. When you plug it in to charge, a female voice tells you it is charging, when it is full charged, and when it is turning on. It's funny because I couldn't find the power button until I looked at the manual. It is on the side of the headset, right on the Turtle Beach logo.  This is a great headset, and works great with the PS4. All the controls to adjust volume, and mic settings are on the right hand side of the headset.  I like this and if you are looking for a PS4 headset, I would consider this.  I hope this review was helpful!

Ok, so I knew going in that this was multi-player only, so was not disappointed like some people.  The campaign (if you even want to call it that) leaves a lot to be desired, but the multi-player, which this game was truly made for, makes up for it.  There are only 6 maps (9 in total after buying DLC) but they are big enough it doesn't get stale too quickly.  I have been a Call of Duty fan since Modern Warfare and have gotten them on launch day religiously.  This breathes much needed new life into the genre.

She loved the way they put the diamond at the corner of the heart instead of boring right at the middle like other common necklaces. This is my fourth necklace I gave to her and she like this the most even though it not the most expensive one she got.

I highly recommend grabbing the http://fave.co/1bKQtXx  Being that I only really purchase Samsung televisions, picking the brand of blu-ray player was simple. I also have Amazon Prime (which I strongly suggest purchasing) and this was eligible for free shipping which was a convincing factor.  I picked up some of these since my TV didn't have any. http://fave.co/1c3wkNc  The player itself is incredibly lightweight. The top of the player has a small touchpad that allows you to control the player easily in-case you lose the remote. The remote is standard as far as Samsung products go. If you're unfamiliar with Samsung electronics: all remotes works for all products. That means this remote works for my television as well as the blu-ray player. And, indeed, this was the case.  Next, I set up my Netflix account to be associated with the player. It didn't provide me with an access code and instead had me log in with my email and password. Fine with me; saved me the trouble of opening my laptop and whatnot. It will keep you logged in until you decide to log yourself out; this includes shutting the player off. Netflix was very responsive and I have zero issues with it still. It also has Hulu and Pandora on it but I don't use those often so I didn't bother checking them out.  I turned it on and decided to choose the quick-start option, which allows for the player to remain in an active sleep state when not in use. When you're ready to use the player, it turns on immediately. When I say immediately, I really mean immediately. There is virtually no delay when pressing the power button on the remote for the player. I've used products with quick-start options in the past and none were as responsive as this.   Overall for the price, this player is easily the best on the market right now. My one complaint is that it doesn't have wifi. I had to hard wire it into the router but we keep it next to the television anyway so this was a non-issue. Still, it's a little strange that it wouldn't have wifi being that this is the most recent model of *this* Samsung product. It's the year 2014; we have dedicated wifi in airport bathrooms. Why isn't this blu-ray player equipped properly?

What can I say? I went to WM to buy a wall mount and the cheapest one they had for my set was $89. But this one is a fraction of the cost and works fine.<br /><br />I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to do so here. This is a great product and extremely easy to assemble/install! This wall mount is great. Priced right, easy to install, and very slim & compact. The box contains clear directions and all the hardware is organized into compartments. Better than expected. The design of this wall mount is superior to the models compared with others. The mount is not visible at all even behind an ultra thin LED LCD TV.<br /><br />I purchased this mount for a Zenith 50&#34; flat panel TV. It had a VESA 400 x 400 mounting pattern. The vertical bars are two-piece, with the lower portion of the bracket needed to accommodate the 400 mm vertical spacing. Easy to hang, came with all the appropriate hardware and even came with a level! All in all, it took less than 10 minutes to get the TV on the wall. It seems to be very sturdy and it's easy to remove the TV if you have to plug anything else in.<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with this mount. Buy it! It's outstanding!

I wasn't sure if I needed these but with a trip coming up I ordered them with hopes that it would make packing (a task I dread) easier. When they arrived I was excited at how nice these packing cubes actually were.<br /><br />The zippers are strong, the color is vibrant and the material is lightweight but strong and the stitching is durable. I love that they have handles and that they are double stitched for easy no worry carrying.<br /><br />I like the mesh on the front so you can see what is packed. The Shoe bag is a great size, I fit 6 pairs of adult shoes and could have fit in 1 or 2 more. I also found the shoe bag can double as a laundry bag when traveling.<br /><br />The varying sizes make for great organization and a number of different uses. I found that the two bigger sizes were great to use for clothing. After my flight, my clothes were less wrinkled than usual because they didn't slide all over the suitcase. The smaller sizes were great for keeping my family's medications neat and handy in my carry on and for personal care items and electronic accessories and cords.<br /><br />I am very happy with these packing cubes and wonder how I ever packed before without them. It's a great way to pack your things neatly and be able to find them quickly. A definite must have for travelers, whether you travel frequently or only every so often!

Martin Shaw's reserved homicide expect George Gently is a great foil for the period in history itself, early 60's England, when the Scandals of the Profumo affair and a growing cynicism with authority led to widespread police corruption and clashes between authority and youth. His partner, young John Bacchus, is on the verge of being a bent copper himself, with a penchant for abusing prisoners and cutting corners. Watching George try to keep Bacchus from making the mistakes other officers have made is key to how their relationship develops. The mysteries themselves are puzzlers and quite clever, with lots of red herring suspects and some contemporary undercurrents. A brilliantly written show.

Our whole family just loves the Lego games. It's a very well designed game and is great for kids to play. The main feature that we love is that when your character dies, you don't have to start from the beginning. You just appear right where you died and can keep going. THAT is great when kids are playing this game.<br /><br />The Indiana Jones game is based on the movie and have a lot of fun scenes from the movie. Of course kids would probably not recognize them, but as the parent you do. We have all the Lego games on X-box and Nintendo and just love them.<br /><br />The game can be played over and over, because even when you have finished it, you can go back and play levels to look for secret treasure and use the new characters you have unlocked. It just don't stop, it can be played for weeks.<br /><br />My son has played the Lego games since he was about 6, and he is great at them. He learns to figure out all the little tricks and secret ways to get the bonus items. It really is a great game. We are always looking to see what their latest Lego game will be and right now we are waiting to buy Lego Super Heros!

As a huge fan of Netflix, I am ecstatic that I can now watch all my shows and movies on my TV instead of my small laptop screen.

When I talk about the dial It has got a very sleek metallic frame which gives a formal classy look. 12 hour number coordinates add even more attraction towards the dail resulting in the beaty of the richness.

[[VIDEOID:mo1LKDPXHDOWZ1R]]These are quality mics that were affordable and sound excellent. It's an easy system to set up and operate, everything was included to get started. Nothing feels cheap or junky about any of the parts. It really doesn't have the clarity and power that you might get out of a single microphone plugged into an amp because it's simply multiple mics running off it's own antenna receiver. However, it works perfectly for getting voices heard over a conference, church- something like that, it's perfect. And, it allows multiple people to have a mic and not have to pass one around.. that is always awkward and wastes time. It's a fantastic system! I posted a video that hopefully shows the system well and shows you all that it comes with and how it works.

I was a bit worried about the purchase I made because of the some bad reviews I read but I bought it still. Upon receiving it, I was very happy that it fits me just right! I have no problem about the fit, really! Aside from that, the design is absolutely pretty! It looks very elegant. Most of my friends thought that is very expensive. I am very happy about my purchase!

I'm just starting out in the music business, so I can't afford to spend a lot on equipment. Most of the coffee shops I perform at don't have their own gear, so I needed to buy my own mic stand, mic and so on, and this stand was much closer to my budget than any of the others I looked at. Boy was I happy to see whole strong and durable this stand is, since it has to last me until I start hitting it big. Sure was happy to find this.

This is the kind of bag I was looking for my college classes. The leather is amazing and very soft. Th color is beautiful and well-polished, the stitching is terrific and holds the leather firmly. It's very comfortable to carry because of its light weight.<br /><br />Be sure to buy this only from ECOCRAFTWORLD as I have been scammed before by a seller showing the exact same picture and receiving a low quality bag when it delivered. EccocraftWorld has provided the true quality and gives you the exact thing shown in the picture. Over all, I'm really happy with this amazing bag.

I shop at Serbags often because I love the quality of their bags. I actually bought this bag through their main website but decided I would share my thought on amazon so everyone could understand how awesome these bags really are. The quality is outstanding. I have been using this bag for about a year and there is no sign of ware and it is as durable as the day I bought it.<br /><br />I get complements all the time on the army inspired look. The bag is made to hold a large amount of content, and contains all the comfort I have been looking for in a messenger bag. I love the cushion that is on the shoulder strap, it is really helpful when carrying a heavy load. I have dealt with Serbags customer care as well and they are outstanding.<br /><br />The pockets on the sides and front are so nice when wanting access items quickly. I completely recommend using Serbags, as they provide outstanding products!

My 12 year old daughter wanted a violin just out of the blue. Violins can be very expensive, yet being able to purchase a new one with colors to choose from for a fickle 12 year old girl at this price was an easy decision.<br /><br />The package came quick with everything expected, and the violin was not cheaply made. Yes if she ever learns to play, most likely she'll gravitate to one that will cost more, but for the money every parent can afford to by their kids an instrument to keep them interested in music and learning to play.

My longevity ForceCut 42i is one of the better investments I've made in a while. I'm not new to welding or cutting metal as I've a small workshop out of my garage, but this tool helped me to do everything almost three times as fast. I could not believe how fast I was doing all my work. I managed to speed up my whole process and began doing more work than I could ever dream of. The workload felt unchanged. The change to 220v is also a really big bonus for me. Easy to use, and very effective, I love it.

Whether evaluating presentation, performance, ease of operation, versatility, this  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SMBGGV6  is without a doubt one of the best you can get these days at this price level. It's a large sound bar plus subwoofer and satellite speakers set that support just about any type of 'wired' connection including HDMI  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00NH126Q0  out with ARC and can also pair and play off Bluetooth supporting devices such as phones or tablets.<br /><br />Just to get it out of the way, I am going to start with the negatives, few as they are and will follow with a detailed description of what you are getting. So, here are the negatives:<br /><br />- Partially wired. The satellite speakers are in fact wired to the subwoofer, probably a small price to pay for true surround.<br />- 5.1 surround, not 7.1 or 7.2. Yes, it's a sound bar, not a full surround speakers set.<br />- Can't play off USB thumb drives or SD cards directly. You will need some Bluetooth device for that.<br /><br />And that's it, all the negatives I can think of so let me discuss the system overall.<br /><br />PRESENTATION AND PACKAGING<br /><br />As I noted above, this is a massive set and Vizio did an excellent job to get everything in a neatly organized box with all components clearly labeled and easy to locate. This is what's in the box:<br /><br />∙ the 54&#34; bar<br />∙ subwoofer<br />∙ 2 satellite speakers<br />∙ remote control and batteries<br />∙ cables: optical, stereo RCA 3.5 mm, coax, HDMI, 2 satellite speaker, 2 power cables  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00NH126Q0<br />∙ mounting hardware: 2 sound bar wall mount brackets, 2 sound bar wall mount lugs, 2 satellite speaker wall mount brackets, 2 satellite speaker wall mount lugs<br />∙ wall mount template<br />∙ 4 Velcro cable ties<br />∙ Quick Start Guide<br /><br />All of the above are quality items and I experienced near zero frustration getting them out of the box. Even better, just in case you may wish to return your purchase, there is a nice diagram on the box that shows exactly where everything is so, for as long as you don't destroy the Styrofoam it should be easy to get everything back in.<br /><br />SETUP<br /><br />Getting everything to work was quick and easy.<br /><br />The Manual is very well written and it covers and illustrates the speakers layout, mounting and how everything is connected. It explains clearly how to use the HDMI's ARC feature with your TV (make sure that the TV supports it if you are going to buy a new one) and how to wire several devices to the bar, taking advantage of its many ports.<br /><br />By the way, you get: RCA Analog Audio In, Optical, 3.5mm Analog Audio In, Digital Coax Audio In, HDMI Out (ARC), HDMI In and USB. And, of course you can pair wirelessly via Bluetooth. The bar supports aptX, allowing real-time streaming of high quality stereo audio over Bluetooth.<br /><br />OPERATION<br /><br />The set comes with a great, simple and effective remote control. It really comes down to selecting the proper input and then let it roar, so to speak. The manual explains how you can integrate the system into another 'universal' remote. I haven't tried that yet but it appears to be very much the standard remote 'learning' process.<br /><br />The subwoofer has a wireless link to the main bar which was properly set in my case but, just in case, there is a pair button also. All wires are properly labelled and, as I noted already, the manual explains how you can have several devices connected. All was quickly done for my experimental setup involving a TV and a gaming console.<br /><br />When paired with a Bluetooth device, your phone or tablet or laptop have complete control over what is playing on the bar.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br /><br />Getting to the final question of 'how does it sound', the brief answer is 'it sounds grrreat'. Thanks to the satellite speakers, this is true 5.1 surround, not a simulationand it's done through some good quality hardware.<br /><br />Talking specs, this is what you get:<br /><br />∙ Sound pressure Level (system): 104 dB<br />∙ Frequency response (system): 45 Hz - 20 KHz<br />∙ 2 3&#34; full range transducers (bar, one left and one right)<br />∙ 2 3x6&#34; bass radiators<br />∙ 3&#34; full range transducer (bar, center)<br />∙ 2 3&#34; full range transducers (one per each satellite)<br /><br />SUPPORT AND WARRANTY<br /><br />Vizio promises lifetime support for the product to cover setup, connecting and technical problems. They also have a one-year limited warranty.<br /><br />RATING<br /><br />I have no choice but award Vizio's bar 5 stars because I love it. It's as close to ideal for anyone looking for a 'serious' bar to work with a large TV that delivers great surround and plays off mobile devices. Get the http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SMBGGV6

Easy to set up and navigate. Pros: 1) Excellent customer service 2) Room filling sound 3) Excellent bass 4) Attractive profile 5) Easy bluetooth Cons: 1) No treble adjustment 2) No memory for each listening mode 3) No HDMI inputs for uncompressed audio formats such as DTS HD or DD plus 4) No HDMI ARC for controlling volume with the televisions remote. Just another remote to use and have family members bitch.  I was looking for something with great sound To replace my surround sound system which just takes up to much room. I got what I wanted with this sound bar and wireless sub. Paring the bar and sub was very fast and simple to do after that I just connected the bar to my tv and everything was ready to go. I don't miss my surround sound this bar is far better and much easier to use. Sound is clear and powerful rather it be from the tv or from my phone with the Bluetooth connection.

I bought this watch because, like a couple of other reviewers, I needed an analogue watch with a second had for my nursing course.  Due to the fact that this one is white, it didn't look to showy or garish - just plain, simple and elegant with just a touch of colour on the numbers on the dial, to stop it being boring.  It's great for using as a timer to take pulses and is also waterproof, so I don't need to take it off to wash my hands, which I do a lot.<br />The ONLY downside is the fact that if you wear any darker colours with it, the strap is a little porous and darker colours attach themselves to it.  However, this doesn't stop the watch functioning really well and doing what you need it to do.

The charge will last at least 5-7 hours on a full charge and around 2 on a quick charge. You have to take into account the weather conditions and working volume. I found if the temperature exceeds 90 degrees or drops below 40 the battery life is affected slightly. I'm not sure exactly why this occurs?; I haven't used the PA in these extreme conditions often, but found this to be true. Based on practical use and affordability...a real winner.

The diamond saws cut through the granite pretty quickly. You have to keep it very cool, I used a water spray bottle for cooling as I cut the hole. Without the coolant, they will wear out quickyl. No problems so far. These are not the professional type that lasts 300 holes, but for a do it your selfer, like myself, this is good-enough. I don't need a diamond hole saw to do 300 holes. That said I think I will get a very good number of holes out of one of each saw Provided, you keep it cool while drilling. This kit has all the sizes I needed and more. I would buy this set again if I had to do it over.

The closet is very small so I was not sure if this product would work.  I know the description mentions the ability to cut the holder for smaller spaces but I didn't need to do that.  Instead,  I was only able to use 3 of the levers.  Even though they are not even flush with the wall and the levers still hold all 3 items. I was very impressed with this product and would recommend it for large or small areas.

I am now able to send Youtube, Netflix, or even browse my iPhone photos and videos to my television for my whole family to enjoy.

I don't know what I did without it!  I love that it can also be used with a projector and other media devices as well.

A great all around drill for $50 i must say! I have three cordless drills that are pretty cheap and was getting sick and tired of the batteries always dieing in the middle of my projects which is a pain in the rear and very frustrating....also a lot of money in batteries. I dont mind an extension cord because i'm usually working in one place at home so not a hassle there. My only problem with the drill is the vsr. It goes from 0 to 2500 rpm way too fast and there isnt much &#34;in between&#34; rpm. So be carefull when driving screws because its very easy to go too deep. I still like it though and would recommend to anyone that needs a good drill for a long time.

We bought this as a Christmas/Birthday gift to my godchild. We were expecting a bigger pendant of Elsa's face but it turns out that it's smaller than we expected. The necklace is less than attractive as I've imagined it.

Good job on putting Elsa's face by the way.

These are very cute Kids Flip Flops by Mottos! I really love them! They came packaged so cute. Perfect for giving as a gift. I bought these for my son and he was so excited to get these in the mail. They come in such a colorful lunch box type box with a handle so you can carry it around. It also comes with a cute and useful black lightweight bag/backpack to carry things in. My son is 7 years old and wears a size 4-4.5 shoe. I ordered the size 5 Mottos flip flops. I wish these were just a bit bigger for him as they just barely fit. They are a slimmer type fit which is good for some people but for my son they were a bit narrow. Definitely order a size larger and you should be just fine. From what I saw, size 5 was the largest size available for me to order so that is why I choose size 5. My son really likes the cute charm that this comes with. He got a monkey on a surfboard. It is probably really fun to buy more charms and then be able to switch them. These seem very well made and like they will last. I am happy I made the purchase!

I had been looking at players for sometime. The LG, Panasonic, Samsung, and Sony offerings were all about the same price. LG http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BD7UVKI Panasonic http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00AYB3OMG Samsung http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00ICDAAXO Sony http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00U1SWZV8  I had minimal requirements: must play blurays, upscale DVDs, have optical or coaxial audio out, and 3d is preferred (simply because I wanted to test it out on my F8500 Plasma). http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BCPGOD4  This fit the bill.  My final two were the Samsung H5900 or this player. Both 3D, Both good reviews. At retail they were about evenly priced. I ended up getting this player for $64.99 Shipped. It is a fantastic player and I couldn't be more pleased.  I don't use the apps on it since my TV has them and I'm a rare HTPC user for 90% of my content. However, once I connected it to my network it did find some media on my desktop and I could stream it without even trying to. It had no issues streaming HD rips (10gb or so) via its connection.  I haven't had a single issue with any discs I've put into it. The interface is simple and functional, perhaps not the prettiest, but I could care less. Blurays look fantastic, the color really pops and the movies are crisp. It outputs 1080p/24p which my F8500 handles wonderfully. Completely smooth.  I do have one complaint, but I won't take off a star since the whole industry does this: For those of us with receivers and audio gear, keeping gear the same width and stackable has huge advantages, this unit replaced a full width Marantz DVD player, and its 7 inches smaller. Please bring back this style and not just at your top tier, the 7200 that has the audio gear case offers no benefits over the 6500 for $100 more.  I hope this review was helpful!

Alright, let me try to be the least biased I can be. This system in my opinion is amzing. While the graphics may not be on par with the Xbox One and PS4, the games in my opinion are a good chunk of what makes a console great and Wii U has some GREAT first party games! Now, as for third party games there are some games that are very good, and while the graphics may not be on par, the gameplay for me is a lot more enjoyable. Now, I am a PC gamer, I love having great graphics, which is why I was hesitant in buying the Wii U. But I get almost all my 3rd party support on PC, so why buy a console that has CERTAINLY not as good first party games. And the gamepad is wonderful, it is another reason I bought the Wii U, I am typing right now on the gamepad. It just makes everything more enjoyable. Alright well, I could go on and on but this, sadly, was my short reveiw. Thanks for listening

Firstly the shipping service is so fast,great! The laser measure works very effectively. I used it with my designer, as we were having structural work done to my new house. He gald to told me that it can be put into his pocket smoothly.<br />The measuring distance is about 196.85ft, the usage is quite intuitive for basic measurement, and learning to use it for a more complex calculation is not that hard at all.<br />It make measuring a lot easier, easy to use and it very accurate. If you're in decoration profession, like DIY or general contractor I would recommend this rangefinder.

I waited a while before I purchased this because of all of the negative reviews about lag and bugs.  I played Rogue first, and then Force Unleashed, I found this on Amazon for $30 near the end of December and assumed most of the glitches were fixed by then.<br /><br />I am about 68% of the way through the game and it is awesome!  The multi-player missions give excellent rewards and the que is never long on the playstation network.  There is a ton of missions all over the map and the companion app adds to the experience.  The battle system takes some getting use to, but after you've played for a while you'll be able to take on 3-4 guys at a time, as long as there aren't any snipers around :P<br /><br />If you are a fan of the whole assassin's creed franchise, you will enjoy this game.  If you came in late, say around ac 3 or 4?  It may not be as fun for you due to the lack of crazy naval battles and a throwback to the ground level exploration of ac1 through ac revalations.

The 110v and 220v operation makes it capable for welding 6013, 7018 and other electrodes for stick welding. This is a very smart and light weight machine which is also able to weld aluminum in AC mode. It is featured with a high frequency foot pedal for a better control and perfect operation. To me it is the best machine that I could get for the performance that I need from a welding machine.

The bag is quite spacious and enables me to carry a lot of my personal belongings such as laptop, documents, pens, chargers and USB cables.<br /><br />I can carry the retro messenger bag either under my hands or on my shoulders.

This is my second time mounting a projector on the ceiling. My first projector was the Epson Powerlite HC 2000, and I figured that being kind of handy I could save some money and go with a universal mount. Let me tell you, that was a mistake I will never make again. Universal mounts are supposed to be made to fit any projector, thereby requiring you to figure which out of the 9000 pieces they give will work for your projector. Again, given enough time I can usually figure things out, and I made it work, but it wasn't worth my time let alone the 30 or so bucks I saved.<br /><br />So, I recently bought the Optoma HD141x and while looking through the mount selection, I came across this mount which is specifically designed for this projector. To put it plain and simple, IF YOU ARE BUYING THE OPTOMA HD 141x, BUY THIS MOUNT!!! Setup was a breeze and this thing is so reasonably priced. This mount is attractive and unobtrusive, and blends right in with the projector. It only sends you the pieces you need and the instructions are simple and clear. It is so easy to adjust the projector to line up perfectly with the screen... just make sure you do your homework and place it the proper distance. I mounted in a drywall ceiling, using two anchor type screws that are simple, effective and sturdy. This mount is the way to go, don't be fooled by the low price and assume quality has been sacricficed... this is the perfect mount for the projector.

I had to move last year and was forced to sell my kit and have been without since. The cool thing about an electronic kit is the sound choice options, this is basically why i bought this kit not to mention the price fit.<br />This kit is awesome for many reasons. First the rack and hardware take abuse and the sound system has power.<br />This gives different sound choices which is cool if your exploring music styles and want to change things up. The pads are tough and the overall sound IS AWESOME! The only downfall is it looks messy with the wires dangling but a few zip ties and problem solved.<br />This is a great price on it!

I got this TV after getting a different one here on Amazon that was just horrible. The speakers hardly worked and when they did it made a robotic sounding noise instead of playing the actual sound it was supposed to. Also, the screen would get fuzzy if I didn't mess with the HDMI cord that was plugged in. No matter which cord I used, the problem still occurred. All in all I just couldn't deal with it any longer in my living room.<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting this TV here on Amazon, please think again --------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1nBMLlW<br /><br />I'm so glad I bought the Sony TV, I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over a month of using it. The sound is great and the picture quality is definitely awesome. I can't see how anyone gave it a bad review!<br /><br />I hope I was able to help point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did!

Very versatile and Easy to setup. I can easily adjust the angle of inclination to adjust for guitar and then vocals. The legs fold up vertically and the stand collapses on itself to be half the size for portability. Like most stands, this microphone stand comes with a clip-on cord holder to keep the microphone cord suspended along the horizontal arm. . I use this stand to hold my heavy AKG perception 120 and SHRUE SM58. All work well. Highly recommend for your budget.

I simply love the quick service this company, Longevity provides. The welding machine was delivered to me in like no time. Hats off guys!!! Did I mention how cool this little machine is? Guys, if you love machines I'm sure you will definitely fall for this one. It's quite handy and uses very less power. Comes with a pre-fitted wire and works like anything. Its pretty safe to use. Has got an overload protection. I haven't seen it getting conked off yet in spite of the long duration of continuous running. Loving it!

Just like its predecessors, Longevity Welding Armor T03-L will give you comfort, style and function all in one.  As a welder, a definitely recommend this product because it gives me a comfortable feeling left by the fine leather material that it is made of as well as the unique design that it possesses.  It is also very cost efficient for welders because of extremely affordable price.  It is lightweight and compact which allows me to take it wherever I may choose to go.  I never regretted availing of this product and neither will you.  Just this is the best investment that I have ever made for sure.

The Longevity Welding Armor M04-L has all the right characteristics that I wanted in my welding gloves.  These are as follows:<br />• Comfort<br />• Safety of use<br />• Style<br />• Function<br />This is the reason why I would recommend this product to anyone who would want to buy their own set of welding gloves from Longevity.  Not to mention the fact that it is very affordable and would not hurt your pockets.  Imagine having the best quality product at a very low price?  It is truly a bargain!  So if I were you I'll go ahead and get myself a pair of gloves like this one before stocks run out.

I purchased the watch for two reasons: the unbelievable price and the large face. It was worth every penny. I love, love, love it! I'm female and have a small wrist so many (8) links had to be removed, but it only cost about 10 dollars at the jeweler. I get some many compliments for it wherever I go, and it goes with everything. Yes it is a bit heavy, but nothing you notice after a couple of times of wearing. Would recommend to anyone without a doubt.

playing Wii with the powersaves SD card is so different now, and i like it very much, first things first, in order to use the SD card you can't just insert it in the Wii, you have to save data into it first, the cheats already come with it but all you have to do is set it up in the computer by inserting the SD card and just download the cheats.<br /><br />you can follow the tutorial on youtube because that is what i did, it was very easy like that following the steps and then also follow the steps about the Wii console, because you also have to save the data of the SD card into the Wii, everything is on the tutorial, and it works very good.<br /><br />the SD card is not only for cheats, you can also save music, videos, and pictures, all that stuff in one SD card how awesome is that!<br /><br />i like it really much and i can recommend this for sure, it's something that is really easy to use and really easy to set up! highly recommended.

It is with strap around the neck so it is really safe , if you are living in a dangerous area where there are a lot of thefts , I think you will need one of these to keep your money and passport safe. You can also keep your cellphone and credit card there , it have plenty of room and also is going to keep your credit card safe thanks to the Rfid blocking material.

I had an old Panasonic DVD/VCR recorder and it finally died. This one: http://fave.co/1ch0tIl  I thought about taking the 100 VHS tapes I have to a professional place to get it done, but at $25 a pop ($2500!!), this machine looked like a better deal. This machine doesn't record to DVD it just lets me watch both. It is very, very easy to 'install.' Unlike my last one, I didn't have to deal with red/yellow/green/blue/white jacks, trying to figure out what goes where.  They do have that option, but one HDMI cable did the trick instead. http://fave.co/1bSNht5  You can't watch and tape TV through it (no tuner), but we have a DVR with our satellite dish, so we didn't need that. It does the job easily. I thought about getting a Toshiba but this machine is simple, IF you follow the simple, illustrated directions. http://fave.co/1cwIIWj  Directions are simple and clearly printed. I only had to look at a few pages because I'm only interested in the dubbing part of it. I don't care about any other features. However, we do watch DVDs on it as well, and we were amazed at the quality. Our old Panasonic had really gotten bad and we didn't even realize it. This new one has a great picture.  I had never heard of Funai, but for the price I was willing to give it a try. Since I have no clue how long it will last I bought the extended warranty (cheap). If it gets all my videos done, it will be more than worth the price.  In the end I recommend buying the: http://fave.co/1cwILkQ  I hope this review was helpful

Being a pretty experienced gamer, I've always been a huge fanatic of super smash brothers. I also happened to get the Wii U since I used to play it when I was little. So I recently got a Gamecube Controller Adapter for Wii U and I can tell you for sure my gaming has improved. I like it because it's simple to use and there is not configuring anything to make it work. You just plug and play; and you are on to enjoy your game. Not to mention the convenience it offers, now up to for 4 of my friends can visit me over the weekend and we can challenge each other to see who still rules in the Wii World. This is a great investment that you won't ever regret about.

I was surprised to see how fast PS4 modded controllers came out. This mod works flawless, and never skips a beat. Does wonders for Call of Duty Ghosts. Very simple to use, and there are tons of options. My game has definitely improved, that extra fire rate and some of the other functions such as drop shot and jump shot really do give you the edge. And I like how you can adjust the settings for each mode so you can choose to jump once, continue jumping, or whatever you choose. Mods can stack too which is nice. Very solid product.

This is a beautiful spacious soft handbag with the perfect touch of bling. I purchased the rose gold color and it is spot on. The only suggestion I have is that since there is zero structure to this bag, would Joan please consider adding either snaps or velcro closures to the open pockets since anything inside them falls out every time you pick up or set down the bag. Thanks. Every time I'm out with it I get at least one compliment!

This game was so impressive that I'm actually considering buying a ps4. I played this at a friend's home while I was housesitting while he was away. I absolutely loved it to bits. I must say that I have played a lot of games like this before, but yet, it was still nothing like this. The best part is that its endlessly replayable, almost, and I can see my self botting this game up 4-5 times before reselling or trading it. It's easy to lose track of time while playing this.

I recently got this guitar stand for my niece who is learning to play the acoustic guitar.  Her parents did not want anything drilled into their walls so a stand or case was really the only way to go.  I am glad that I got her the stand as it kept the guitar in constant view which encouraged her to play more frequently.  It is so easy for her to pick and play and once the she is done, she can place it securely back on the stand.  It's discreet enough (more or less with a big guitar on it) that her parents are not complaining.  I have seen her easily close up the stand and carry it with her outside and to other parts of the house.  She says she really likes how convenient and portable it is.  For me, I am just glad I able to support her growing love of music.  I really recommend this stand for any guitar player and especially as a gift to a loved one.

I am so happy to have received this Travel Duffel Buddy Bag by aGreatLife! This bag is awesome! It comes all folded and zipped up. It weighs 2 pounds and can hold 50 pounds. It is packaged very well and even with a nice plastic bag case protecting it all. Once I unzipped it open, wow, it was so big!! My kids had fun seeing if they could fit inside and sure enough, they could! :) The material is thin but sturdy feeling. It is black but has a nice diamond design on it. It is also water resistant, resistant to tearing, and it is fire retardant. The main part of the bag opens nice and wide with its U shaped zipper opening. There are even handy smaller zippers on the outside of the bag which I love. It has a nice strap that you can connect that has extra padding on it. Also the smaller straps on it velcro closed. This bag would be so perfect to take with you to the airport. It is the right size and can be checked in. It is also perfect to keep inside the outside zipper of your main suitcase in case you go over the allowed weight. If you do, no problem, you can open up your Buddy Bag and then fill it up to be checked in as a second bag. This bag is great also for camping or weekend trips. It is good to store blankets or anything in also. I really love this product and my family and I will give it lots of good use!

These are great tags for your luggage. They're stronger than any other tag I've seen, so you wont loose them during travel.The tag is cute and it looks as pictured, but it is for decoration only. I ordered the blue, and it's little more of a darker royal blue than the picture, but they still look great.

If you are new to online media streaming and media boxes just like me and don't know how to setup/ add add-ons on android tv box, have someone who can be available to help you set this up. Otherwise, You will end up hating it and will not even 10% of it's features/services.<br /><br />After adding my Google account, all my Android apps were there ready to be downloaded. I found the device UI fairly simple and streamlined. They use a simple set of &#34;rows&#34; broken down into several categories (Favorites, Video, Music, etc.) All the rows can be easily edited to add additional app icons to them.<br /><br />No issues streaming content and the box works great. The graphics are even better than expected. As this will not be used much for gaming, my main concern was mostly for streaming media. So far I have tested Netflix, Hulu, Play Music, Play Movies. All of which work without issue.<br /><br />It is rich with lots of free streaming add-ins. So, I have already cancelled my cable service.<br /><br />The 16GB internal storage is well enough to install apps without having to always worry about running out of space.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with my purchase, and as I get into more streaming (from home network) and start getting more into the ins and outs of Kodi, I will learn more and find out good features of this device and update more into this review. However, for someone coming from Google TV, this is definitely a step up.

So far so good. I had purchased a  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00UJ3IULO  which I was not able to use, after trying it on two TV's and after spending an hour on the phone with Direct TV tech support.<br /><br />Why buy a streaming unit like Roku, Apple TV or Google Nexus Player for $99 when this is available for less and includes gaming and blue ray support? Response to the nice remote control is snappy and playing streaming seems effortless. The user interface is familiar to anyone that has a PS3/PS4 or prior generation Sony streamer/ player.<br /><br />The unit does sacrifice some features to make its price that may or may not be meaningful. The list:<br />1. Its tiny and light (bad for the fans of bigger and heavier is better)<br />2. No old connections, this is strictly HDMI. Make sure you get a http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00NH126Q0<br />3. Probably not state of the art internal components.<br />4.

I'm 100% satisfied with just about everything about it. And it fits right with my http://fave.co/1bA3TFH  I had only saw the http://fave.co/1bPOFNv in person but I thought for the price and w/ the DW brand behind it the 3500 would be &#34;beefier&#34; looking than it is. The tube diameters are the same as most entry level hi-hat stands. It looks a little diminutive. In my opinion it has a jazz or bebop kit look if that makes sense. Nonetheless seems solid enough and the overall function is really nice.  The pedal action is buttery smooth, tension adjustment is nice, really like the design of the bottom cymbal angle adjuster (no probs. w/ it backing out, all metal, and it's easy to get to), 15&#34; upper rod leaves space for tight overhead clearance and has a &#34;clean&#34; look, no problems w/ the stand staying put despite having a small foot print behind the kit and the locking clutch is a nice touch especially for &#34;harder&#34; players.

I recently purchased some of the Mutez.  My first intial thoughts when they arrived was good, the packaging looks cool, the barcode has a stage diver on it and the earplugs come neatly in a sweet little case.   I had a pair of custom moulded earplugs for quite some time and ended up losing them so thought I would try these out as a replacement. I did some research on what ones I should get,Turns out these are actually better than my old cutom ones and they didnt cost me $200!! I highly recommend them the only thing i could say is they do however take a little bit of getting use to ase you have to push them quite far in. The sound quality is really good, as they decribed you can still hear the music very clearly while giving a good level of protection.

alright so i see some of the people that have reviewed about the item i think they don't know what is it for, first of all i use it when i play with mario bros, now the way it works is that when you use it, the SD card gives you infinite lives and you don't have to worry about it, is as if you were using cheats but you really using something that is allow in the game, is a little confusing to explain but i think everyone should try it.<br /><br />i only use it for mario bros not with any other games, i haven't tried it because i really don't own any games but in the bottom of the package it is names all the games it is capable of doing the "cheats" is a really good thing if you cant pass a level or if you are stuck on one.<br /><br />i highly recommend it, is really godd but is only for nintendo.

This is an excellent cover for laptop. I was very impressed with the lining that has an egg crate type for rubber lining to help pad the laptop very nicely.  There is also a little extra wiggle room to slide the computer in very easily without extra stretching or squeezing to try to get it in bag. Top quality stitching at the seams that looks like it will be very durable for a long time of use. Great price too. We bought one of each of our kids for their laptops at the same price and this cover was by far a much better quality!

I want to first clarify some points others have been making in the reviews on this TV. http://fave.co/1bKze8H  Additionally you should really check out some of these as well, they are AMAZING with this TV http://fave.co/1c3gwKa  It IS indeed 120hz, the person who left that review obviously had no idea what they were talking about. I've seen people dock it stars for the lack of smart functionality. This is not a smart TV. It has a basic,navigable, and responsive menu. I have also seen docked stars for lack of ports. The site plainly lists how many ports the TV has, it's your own fault if you expected it to have more.  I have something plugged into every port on this TV, except the USB port (I have no need).  Xbox 360 plugged into the Component inputs (old style 360), WD Media Player into 1 HDMI, and a future HDMI cable already run for my future Xbox One. I also have standard coax cable hooked up to this TV as well. This is all I need the TV for, which is why I went with this one vs a TV with more options since budget was an issue.  I haven't yet tweaked with the picture settings yet, but plan to and I hope to update this review when I do.  Pros: -Beautiful display. My friends have commented on it's sharpness, color, and thin bezel. Minimal glare, if any in my setup. -Absolutely perfect response time. I am a very heavy gamer, and this works great for FPS and fast response games. If you plan on using this for any game console, this is your TV. -Absolutely no 'soap opera' effect. -Color and Blacks have been very impressive. My previous LCD LG (i think 09 model) would go to 'lit black' on dark scenes, kind of like an extremely dark grey. I would say this TV is as close to real color and contrast as you can get. -Nice sized remote, not a wii type. -This TV does have a physical power button on the bottom, that is kind of like a joystick you can navigate a mini menu. Cool feature. -Optical out, which I also use with a Soundbar/Wireless sub-woofer. -True 16:9. Fits fully onthe screen, no black bars.  Cons: -Wall mount issues. I have this TV wall mounted with the popular Cheetah mount on Amazon. If i could go back I'd choose a different wall mount. The ports on this TV are basically right in the middle of the back in the TV, right where the brackets for a wall mount go across. The Xbox 360. Coax, and HDMI fit, but BARELY. They are pressed hard into their slots from the bracket of the wall mount, and take hard right angles. Terrible design for the ports, I wish they were the waterfall type.  -I expected the built in speakers to be a little better, but I'm being pretty picky here. I only listened for about 10 mins before I hooked up my quality Soundbar just to test.  He also lifted the TV out of the box, the opposite of how it's meant to be unboxed (TV drops out the bottom, box comes out on top). Terrible vendor shipment, I blame Amazon for this, not the product or manufacturer. Probably my first negative experience with Amazon shipping something.  Other thoughts: -I did have a negative experience with shipping this TV. took 2 weeks to get here via prime, and then the delivery driver entered our home with my young teenage sister, and forced her to help unbox the TV to make sure it worked. She called me at work and I rushed home. He was in desperate need of a shower and a haircut, and I forced him to leave.  -You will need another person to help wall mount, if you plan to. Math and measuring required, bring your thinking cap. -I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a budget upgrade with not all the 'thrills, apps or 3D gimmicks'. I sit about 12 feet from this TV, and that is about perfect for games and very ideal for TV and Movies.  Get this you'll thank me. http://fave.co/1bKze8H  I hope this review was helpful!

My only complaint<br />is that the money pocked is a little smaller then on my old belt. BUT... I was able to<br />put 10 bills inside of it pretty easily. So... I guess you could store up to $1000 in it<br />if you wanted too.<br /><br />The zipper is nice because it hides pretty flat. They were smart to cut out a little bit<br />of the leather on this inside for the zipper.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars if the buckle attachement to the main part of the belt felt a<br />little more solid and if the money pouch were a little bigger.<br /><br />As it is, I might upgrade my review to 5 stars after a month or so of wearing this belt.<br /><br />I was very nervous of which belt to buy and looking at the reviews helped me a lot.<br />The material of this belt is real leather and is very solid and looks good.<br /><br />>>>><br />OK. I have been using this thing for some weeks now and I wear it EVERY DAY.<br />I am not particularly fat or anything so it is not holding a LOT of pressure BUT...<br /><br />It is working perfectly. The area around the hole and the buckle are staying solid,<br />which was my main fear from my last belt of this type. So... I am moving my<br />review from 4 to 5 Stars.<br /><br />The belt buckle has held up totally fine and I am enjoying the adjust ability of it<br />I list about 1 button hole of weight and if it stays off I will be shrinking the belt<br /> a bit. When I travel I always lose weight so I will wait to seeif it stays off but<br />then i will.

I've been wearing Boots all my life..I was a Truck Driver I drove a 75ft. 13 Car Automobile Transport & I wore the Best Boots like Red Wing,& Browning Boots & all were Waterproff & Insulated.. All the Boots had tie up Laces .. I injured my Achilles Tendon & everytime I tied my Boots up I was putting Pressure on that injury.. so I thought let me try a slip on Boot.. while looking on Amazon's site I saw the Kamik Men's Dawson Waterproff Winter Boot..  I looked at the boot and I liked it.. when I got it  I thought I had my Bedroom Slippers on  it was Comfortable ok now But I have not worn them in the rain or Snow yet  & the price was rite too.

I've just began to do some outdoor exercises and I needed a watch to simply countdown the minutes for me as I wanted to do 30 minutes of walk or swim or jog. I was looking at famous ones like suunto or polar but I think I'll end up spending so much for something that I wont make much use of. this one however is just what I need its a little simpler it gives me the function that I'm looking for and I cant take it to swim. And I like how it looks.

The watch looked big at first but then I got used to it, I sweat a lot so to keep it smelling good I wash the straps every day when I shower, the straps become weak when wet so is not good if your going to be swimming it might loosen up, one nice thing I noticed is that it has three alarms and each one sounds different like a beeper.<br /><br />The buttons are very durable, treat this watch nicely and you will be a happy customer, this watch is not indestructible, I had this for 5 months now and I use it every weekday, I also wear it every day, on my HIIT classes, It still looks new,  I don't even look at my watch, the alarm tells me every time.<br /><br />My most common settings are intervals of 30sec 45sec to 1 min Intervals

I've been looking for some custom Xbox One modded controllers for quite some time now, and I've come across quite a few of them, but this one caught my eye. In person the product looks so much better than the photo. The gold really shines and is a nice color, the back of the controller is black, but it looks very clean and sleek. Only downside is the fingerprints which are easy to remove with a cloth, I even bought a case to protect my controller as I'm so in love with it.<br /><br />The mods work PERFECT. They are activated using the d-pad, which at first I thought might mess me up in game but surprisingly its easy to use, and quick to activate. I have yet to accidentally enable a mod in game. Rapid fire works great as do all the other add ons, I was surprised at how great the mod worked considering the console has not been out very long but no complaints here! Works great on COD Ghosts and Titanfall. Going to be picking up a few of the other chrome colors that Geniusmods offers.

I'm powering it from USB, and have the gains set to 0dB since I'm digitizing a line level input. So far, this little box is working just fine and I do not notice any additional noise over the background of our worship sanctuary. I also love the direct feed thru of the headphone jack which I used to patch our XLR audio feed into the unbalanced input of a telephone system's music on hold + intercom input. PS. it works fine in Linux for web audio streaming.

If you like the idea of combining real dolls with your video game play, this is it. If you follow the tutorial, you will learn how to build levels and navigate through adventure worlds already created within the game.  As long as you watch the tutorial on how to navigate the game, you won't get confused.  One thing I hate about the starter pack is the fact that the figures all come from different games.  If you want to do any 2-player games, you are going to have to buy more figurines.  But hey, this is what it is: a starter pack.  It's not supposed to be a complete set, but when you do buy one, you can have up to four players with the internet.  So, I think it's worth your while if your kids are really into this gaming thing. Who knows? Maybe the next big thing will be the ability to reach through the actual game console screen and move your character around.

A lens that will shout that you are a nerd but a frame that will shout that you are a hottie and a fashion outlet. This is cool for everyday use and you can use it with any outfit. This is best for people with light complexion because the print will not complement those people with darker complexion. This is beautiful but you should take into consideration if the color blends with you skin color well. That is a must-check activity for people who loves fashion.

I dig this amp- i think it could be easily used for a pro setup in a bar for karaoke where u don't want a dedicated system but are just adding somethng it. Nice mics, cool looking and super bright screen. For my money it would be hard to beat for functionality. It's been a few weeks using it now and so far we are super pleased.

Accessories are my guilty pleasure and I have some very expensive pieces, as well as some very inexpensive pieces.  As soon as I saw this particular piece, I had to have it for work.  I generally use my inexpensive pieces for work, as I am a teacher and it is amazing how quickly clothing and bracelets/watches can get damaged in the classroom.<br /><br />The watch arrived promptly, before the estimated shipping date, and was packaged really well.  Upon opening the package, I was surprised by the lovely quality of the watch - especially at the excellent price.  It was a lovely, matt gold colour and quite decently weighty.  The diamonds just add a nice touch of glamour.  In fact, I have had lots of compliments about this watch from friends who have thought it was a more expensive brand.<br /><br />My only criticism would be the size of the strap - it is huge!  Although, it is quite easy to take a couple of links out - so it is not a huge criticism.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this watch to anybody looking for a fashion piece at a reasonable price.

My son loves watches and he loves to hang out at the swimming pool, apparently it is where the girls also hang out. As such, he needed a water proof watch that was also, as he puts it, cool. So, this digital watch was ideal and it is water resistant to 99 feet, which is more than sufficient for any depth that my son will be swimming to.<br /><br />However, a friend of my husbands is an amateur diver and he has a watch like this one to go scuba diving, so it musts stand up to that level of the sport. It has only basic features such as an alarm and timer but what more does a thirteen year old by need with his watch? It does have a small nightlight so he can read the time when it is dark, hand to remind him what time he needs to be back home for. A great watch for a great price.

It took me 10mins overall to apply these screen protectors, but it was well worth my time because they are great and fit like a custom made glove. These 10 long minutes are due to the fact that I abhor dust and air bubbles (so much so that if there is one spec I can see and can't fix I will remove the whole thing and use another one), therefore, I meticulously cleaned both screens, which took the majority of the time. The instructions do seem complicated but if you take the time to look at the pictographs you'll be fine.<br /><br />Basically adhere the protector to your device, grab the protruding end on the right, slowly pull away towards the right, remove air bubbles with the cheap cardboard &#34;tool&#34; they give you (or a credit card), peel off the secondary layer and remove any excess bubbles.<br /><br />If you take the time to make sure everything's dust free you won't regret this purchase. And since you only get one shot I wouldn't rush it, not for $9 bucks a pop.

Congratulations, you just saved $100 from the cheaper version http://fave.co/1c3qCuA  I purchased this TV from an authorized dealer in Seattle because I didn't want to wait. Price was the same, and I would still have to pay tax in Seattle on Amazon. I have owned the 55&#34; version of the TV for a month and a half.  On research I was put off by the XBR900B having better dimming and contrast control but having the speakers on the side that I find to be quite gawdy. I wish there was an intermediate between the it and the XBR850B that had the dimming but not the speakers, but I digress. I checked this out in the store vs the Samsung 8550 and 7150. Both the 8550 and XBR850B blow away the 7150 with the same content moved to each one. I personally prefer the Sony to the Samsung. The Samsung is over saturated and isn't as crisp. The Sony XBR850B just looks better to me. I also tried out the Sony XBR800B and the difference in color is very noticeable.  I started using the stand, but eventually ordered one of these to mount it. It looks GREAT mounted! http://fave.co/1c3qDPf  The menu is easy to navigate. The settings are easy. The out of the box calibration is nearly perfect. The smart app functions work well. The 4K upscaling is incredible. It makes 1080P look like broadcast junk.  The build quality on this is excellent. The camera folds back so it is invisible from the front. I'm sure you have been reading the same things that I did on the interwebs. &#34;Panel Lottery,&#34; &#34;Clouding,&#34; &#34;Flashlighting,&#34; "Soap Opera Effect", etc. There is a tiny spot on the righthand side that I can see being a tad bit brighter. When I first noticed it, I really noticed it. The next day I could hardly see it, and it doesn't distract me at all. A couple adjustments to backlighting and brightness and I can't see it anymore except on boot-up. I don't notice any clouding except maybe on the boot screen, maybe. I do not see it on the netflix screen or anything like that. You can change settings and see Soap Opera Effect, but you can also change those settings back and not see it. Really, that is more of a problem with processor sharping because all LCD/LED tvs are blurry in movement. TVs of this caliber are fast enough to sharpen and make the motion seem natural.  Where the tire meets the road, as the old saying goes, is where this TV shines. Everything is beautiful on it. Streamed Netflix is beautiful, iTunes purchases streamed by the Apple TV are beautiful, Blu-Rays in my PS4 are beautiful, and games on my PS4 are beautiful.  I shopped around. I educated myself. I kicked the tires on many TVs. I was very informed. You really have to spend a lot more coin to get better performance than what this TV delivers and the percentage better is extremely minimal for the large jump in price. At the sale price of $1750 before tax, this is really the best performance for coin spent. Black are deep, colors are vibrant, resolution is incredible, upscaling works flawlessly and makes quite a huge difference, and it is mesmerizing. I am confident that I will enjoy this TV for a long time. I highly recommend this TV. I apologize if this review doesn't have discussions on black room viewing (I turn the brightness down 4 at night and it looks great), TV lingo, what serial number panel is installed (I have better things to do with my life), or every spec of the TV (that is available online easily.) I really enjoy my purchase and think you will too, especially at this price at this time. Also, don't worry about the 4K content, the upscaling is incredible. It will take the industry years to adapt to this since it just adapted to 1080P. This TV looks better than 1080P tv while viewing 1080P content.  In summary, I now recommend all my friends check out the: http://fave.co/1bKKvpy  I really hope you found this review helpful. Jessicaag=i60-25

I bought this on my first hiking adventure and I didn't regret it in buying this "Everest Hiking Pack". The materials used on this product are very durable. I and my friend can attest on this on the multiple major scratches during our trails but it didn't cut off.

I'm not a gamer, but my son is and he just loves these headphones. Why not, he can shut me out and really immerse himself in his games. Which may or may not be a good thing. I limit him to an hour a day after he's done his homework and that seems to be working okay.<br /><br />However, gaming isn't all these headphones are about. I use them for listening to my iTunes playlist while I'm writing in the early hours of the morning. The sound is sublime, nice deep bass  and perfect trebles. With these I immerse myself in my music and my writing while my family sleeps. So these headphones get five stars twice, once from me, once from my son.

This watch is an excellent example for the cost. I really am surprised by some of the reviews when you consider how cheap the watch is, for the price you pay this is excellent. It has all the regular watch features you would find in a more expensive watch such as a daily alarm, hourly chime, EL backlight, unidirectional bezel, dual time display, timer, and date function.<br /><br />It does also come in a variety of colours which is something that cannot be said of its expensive counterparts. These watches are supposed to be imitations of much more expensive watches and they do a god job, they are fashionable and sturdy.<br /><br />If you are after a perfect watch then this not the watch for you, however, if you are after a stylish and affordable watch that really looks the part then this is the one for you.

I love this Glass Infuser Water Bottle by Dr B Goods! It is a high quality glass which is healthier to drink from than plastic. Also, you can use either hot or cold beverages with it. I love the protective silicon sleeve. That gives an extra added layer of protection to the glass and also your hands. The flip top lid is good and secure. So far I have used it to make different flavors of fruit water. I often puts lemons in it because that is so healthy. I have also used strawberries and even frozen berries. This is a great product and I am very happy I made the purchase.

play station is like the best invention ever, after Nintendo 64 of course. the gaming graphics are the best and i really couldn't be happier than having this type of gaming consoles, i bought mine on black Friday which really doesn't make a difference in the price but well it makes myself looked i spend less.<br /><br />the graphics are so much better with the HDMI cable, and if you have the HDMI you don't need to plug in the AV cables, and the best of using the HDMI is that if you turn on the console from the controller the TV will change itself to HDMI and the same when turning it off, it will turn itself to the channel it was (whatever you were using).<br /><br />i like ps3 better than XBOX because online is free and because the controllers feel more comfortable the controllers also are much better because they don't weight as much as the xbox controllers. the ps3 slim is a lot thinner than the ps3 before, that is the only difference, i really can't wait for the ps4 to be released, i heard is in october or somewhere around there so i can't wait for it. highly recommended. but i must warn you that you should wait for the ps4 which will be a lot more better than this one.

For the money, this guitar looks and plays great. Tuning is a little tricky, but it comes with a halfway decent tuner to help you along at first. My suggestion, though would be to pick up a better one at your earliest convenience. The guitar plays really well, and sounds pretty decent through the little amp that's included. If you should hear any buzzing, though, the recommendation is that you take it to your nearest Guitar Center or music store and have a professional look it over. It might need a little bit of adjustment. Other than that, it's worth it if your just starting out.

He instantly ran around the house shouting at the top of his lungs to illustrate his excitement.

I held off purchasing this mouse because I was skeptical that a 40 dollar mouse could sway me not to buy a razer or a steel series gaming mouse. I was wrong. This mouse is hassle free. Extremely comfortable. Easy to use and set up. The software is simple even for non gamers to set up and manage. The clicks sound and feel great. The tracking is superb. The adjustable weights are perfect. There is nothing I can say bad about this mouse. If you are looking for a gaming mouse with out al the bugs or the high price? Get this one! You will NOT be sorry! Been using it for over a month now and I game hard with it. Shooters, mmorpg's, stratedy games, you name it. Cant make this mouse lag out or miss a shot and the easy to click dpi helps you zero in on your selected/intended target very easily. Buy with confidence that it will last you a very long time and that you will be able to use it for any application. Oh....one more thing...I have not found a surface that this mouse wont track on. I even stuck it on my head with all the hair and it still didnt miss a beat lol. BUY IT!

I got this to replace one of my older mods after seeing what this one had to offer (my old one did not have the master mod or trigger stops). The lightweight thing is pretty cool, at first I thought I'd miss the rumbles but it really does make the controller MUCH lighter. Love the metal thumb sticks they definitely grip but mine seem to have the gold chipping a little but I do use it a lot so I don't know if that is normal.<br />Mods all work great, and are easy to use. There is really so much you can do with these mods that I honestly know I won't ever get a chance to try them all out you can customize so much so whether you're a beginner or a master COD player this controller will fit your needs.

My son is now an intermediate clarinet player. He even got his clarinet here! http://amzn.to/1BOijHQ<br /><br />We have been using the Vandorens for a while, and we will most likely stick with them. The unfortunate thing is that the quality of the reeds vary greatly from one reed to another, even within the same box of 10 reeds. This is not unique to Vandorens but with all the other reeds too, from what I hear from expert level players.<br /><br />To deal with varying quality of the reeds, what we have been doing is opening up several reeds at a time, then putting them in a cup of warm water, then having my son play with them for several minutes at a time. Inevitably he can pick out which reeds play the best immediately. Then we label these reeds by marking the back of the reed with a sharpee 1, 2, 3 or 4 stars. We would do this over time with all 10 reeds until all the reeds are categorized. What we have also learned is that over time, some reeds take a bit of &#34;breaking in&#34; period, so it may have to be upgraded from a 2* to 3* or 4*, and other previously highly rated reed may be downgraded over time.<br /><br />Pick up some of these and you'll be happy! http://amzn.to/1GNce4U

This is a great product for home use, but I can't speak to professional use. I've seen big warehouse stores offer lesser quality karaoke machines for a similar price. Although those machines come with a mic and a built in monitor, this has better sound quality, the capability of playing multiple formats as well as playing music from a thumb drive. The only thing I would remind people thinking about buying this is that you have to purchase your  own mics, and hopefully you have a good sound system. (but this is true of most machines).

I just purchased this TV from Costco last night. If anything of substance changes, I'll take the time to post an update.  I had this Sharp TV for about a month now, and so far I have been pretty pleased with my purchase. This is my second Sharp TV. The reason I also bought this 40&#34; is because I've been really pleased with this Sharp here: http://fave.co/1cwFHFn  Things worthy of note: - It is much more convenient to be able to watch digital media directly on the TV than it is to have a Roku, Chromecast or Wii. They are fine devices and you should probably check them out regardless for their extra features, especially the Chromecast if you're getting a different TV. Roku   http://fave.co/1cgU0wU Chromecast    http://fave.co/1cwzERc Apple TV http://fave.co/1cgYiof  - My remote came with the three programmed buttons of Amazon Instant, Netflix and iHeartRadio. Obviously I would prefer them to be Netflix, Hulu Plus and HBOGo, but I suppose that you can't please everyone. It would have been nice if you can reprogram them to your desired channels. - BIG CON: There is a buzzing noise that comes from our TV when it's on. It's quiet enough that you don't hear it when you're watching anything with sound, but when there isn't sound, it can be heard even from the other room. This might be a defect with my specific TV. I will update this review if the noise stops or changes. - The picture and sound are great for my purposes. - Our router/modem happens to be right next to our TV stand, so I do have a wired connection set up. I notice it being slightly faster in load times than wireless, of course, but it doesn't make a huge difference. - I think the TV is worth the money, but I think that I'll return mine to Costco if the buzzing doesn't go away. - I also posted this review on Costco's website, FYI.  It was not a big surprise to me that this TV also works like it should! In one word the TV works great. The picture quality is lovely, the sound is decent (and can be upgrade with a sound bar), and I don't have any daily problems or complaints about it. The remote is a little cheap as others have mentioned, but it works just fine for me, and has a simple layout that is easy to use. This is a smart TV so it has a few preloaded apps and ability to connect to the internet. I had difficulty actually launching and using any of the apps other than the Netflix app, but I have a console to run most of my apps so I found these features pretty good.  In the end I recommend you get yourself this TV. It's worth it. http://fave.co/1cwFVw2

I was a little worried when reading some of the negative reviews about this headset, but I don't think they were even reviewing the right one! This headset is AWESOME, I haven't used a set that sound and feel quite like this. I can wear them for however long I want without them getting uncomfortable. All around I would recommend them to anyone considering it.<br /><br />An additional reason I love them so much is because I recently purchased a different headset here on Amazon that was HORRIBLE. One of the speakers died within a week and the sound quality was not great at all. They were not even close to as comfortable as these!<br /><br />If you are considering getting this headset here on Amazon, be careful ----------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1vGtqQN<br /><br />I hope I could help others by sharing my experience with both headsets and point them in the right direction!

This watch is super cute, and will work great for what I need it for. It's A little wider than most women's watches, but it will work great for what it was bought for. Watch keeps time as it is suppose too. Not sure why everyone is complaining, because the price on this little watch is great.. If you are looking for timex take a lick and keep on ticking quality then keep in mind the price you are paying... It is a little cheaper made than other watches, but also costs far less than other watches. Shipping was not that bad either.. I had mine within two weeks. Not sure if it ships from overseas but I do know that if it does than this is great timing, since overseas shipping usually take 3-4 weeks where I live, and in my opinion shipping time is more than except-able.. I think we are just spoiled by Amazon. If you are looking for something fancy than get off your back pocket and go pay higher price because this is just a basic watch.

Roku updated the Roku 2 and Roku 3. The new Roku 2 is basically the old Roku 3 - but they removed a couple of features. The new Roku 2 is IR only - no more wifi-direct remote so you need line of sight now and no headphone jack in the remote. The Roku 2 is also HDMI only - it WILL NOT work with a CRT TV. I have no idea if Amazon is going to start transparently selling the new Roku 2 if you buy from this page or if this will continue to be the product page for the &#34;older&#34; Roku 2. The older Roku 2 has a model number of 2720R you can find that one here    http://fave.co/1cgYIuK    and apparently the new one is 4210R, obviously here: http://fave.co/1cwGOVA  It looks like the only &#34;current&#34; Roku that will work with a CRT TV is the Roku 1, which (as far as I can tell) is just slower than the &#34;new&#34; Roku 2 but still has composite video output.  SETUP Easy-peasy. Choose language, sign in to network, create an account. Done in 5 minutes. - Minor bug: my wireless network SSID was listed twice. - Minor gripe: had to give my credit card number, but roku.com indicated that I can remove this later via website.  USE Overall, the experience is great. The interface is beautiful and easy to navigate. The remote is simple, responsive, and has great range. Previously, I used my Wii to access Netflix, but the remote range was so small that I had to get up off the couch to control the Wii. With the Roku remote I can control things even from the dining room!  One potential point of confusion is the integration with M-Go. The top level menu has Channels (Netflix, Amazon, Crackle, etc) AND &#34;Movies&#34;, &#34;TV&#34;, etc. At first I thought that &#34;Movies&#34; might mean all movies across all of Netflix, Amazon, etc, but that's not what it is. The &#34;Movies&#34;, &#34;TV&#34; and other selections are actually sub-headings for M-Go, a new Roku partner. I guess as a partner they get premium placement at the top menu level.

You can see them on [...] Just to give you an idea of how the channels work (i.e., free vs subscription vs pay-per-use) I categorized my initial channels below. One way Roku could improve the channel experience would be to aggregate movies across all channels you're subscribed to, subdividing into pay-vs-free so that you'd have essentially one &#34;Roku channel&#34; that de-duplicates movies. The result would be something like TV.com which shows movies and which channels host each one.  Subscription - Netflix ($8/mo) - Amazon Instant Prime Video (included with $79/yr Amazon Prime) - HuluPlus ($8/mo)  Pay-per-use - Blockbuster ($4/movie, has trailers, 4784 videos) - Vudu ($4/movie)  Free - PopcornFlix (commercials) - PBS Kids - WSJ - Crackle (with commercials) - Disney (mostly trailers/commercials, but some actual content) - Fox News (with commercials)  Get this, it's worth it!   http://fave.co/1cgYQKA

Wow this is really amazing! I am kickstater backer of this project and I just received my phonejoy game controller. Seriously speaking I can now enjoy games on my android phone much like a PlayStation vita even much more because there are larger numbers of supported games. This product is worth to wait a year for but now that I finally have it I will enjoy my games with real console experience because I have proper controls now!

At first I was kind of baffled at how to use this toy.  If you're anything like me, you probably would benefit from watching some of the demonstration videos about the toy box before trying to create your own games.  Once you do that, you can have endless hours of gaming fun. It's like having an endless amount of games at your fingertips.  Your kids will use their analytical skills and creative genius to create entirely new games and worlds within the existing game, which means the fun can last forever each time you play!  I really love this set, and I definitely bought some more sets for Christmas!

Mortal Kombat X - Xbox One From a gameplay perspective, Mortal Kombat X easily eclipses everything that's come before it. NetherRealm has taken all that they learned in the making of 2011's Mortal Kombat and Injustice: Gods Among Us to create an MK experience to appeal to both casual and hardcore fans.  The &#34;Kollector's&#34; Edition gets good marks too and in addition to the game you also get a Scorpion Figurine by Coarse, Certificate of Authenticity, Gold Scorpion Skin and Kombat Pack Downloadable Content. It might be worth checking out here:  http://fave.co/1c3tmZ7  Mortal Kombat X does play well. Moving back to 2D combat was the best move for Mortal Kombat after some clunky efforts at 3D play from a couple of generations ago, as it has allowed the team to focus on linear combos and giving the attacks a brutal characterisation behind them.  Balancing is good, though it won't take long for each player to find their favorites. I personally became accustomed to Cassie quickly. Partly because I didn't want to be on the receiving end of the ball busting move, but also because she's quick and her attacks have good flow to them. I found the bigger, heavier characters to be almost unmanageable in how clunky their attacks flowed together, but of course the first time I jumped online I ran into someone who showed me what those characters were capable of (and left me with a shredded Cassie to show for the lesson).  It remains a very accessible fighting game, with relatively small move lists for each character, though at the start of each battle it's possible to select from three different "stances”, which effectively means that each character is three different play styles in one.  The complete list of characters in the game, some of which are classics include: Baraka, Bo' Rai Cho, Cassie Cage, D'Vorah, Daegon, Ermac, Erron Black, Ferra & Torr, Fox, Frost, Fujin, Goro, Jackson Briggs, Jacqui Briggs, Jason Voorhees, Johnny Cage, Kabal, Kano, Kenshi, Kitana, Kotal K'etz, Kotal Kahn, Kuai Liang, Kung Jin, Kung Lao, Li Mei, Liu Kang, Mileena, Nightwolf, Predator, Quan Chi, Raiden, Rain, Reptile, Sareena, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Shinnok, Shujinko, Sindel, Smoke, Sonya Blade, Kurtis Stryker, Suchin, Takeda Takahashi, Tanya, Taven, Tremor  In short I'd recommend picking yourself up a copy of:  http://fave.co/1c3tyHJ

This beautiful travel umbrella opens and closes easily and reliably. Is light weight and very compact, when folded up. It can fit into just about any bag. I like that it feels very sturdy and strong. It is made of high quality products and you can notice it as soon as you open it. The material is a good quality waterproof microfiber that feels almost velvety to the touch. I like that it has a cover with it  It opened and closed with ease. Best of all I didn't have to struggle against the wind to hold it. The handle is also comfortable to hold.  The perfect size umbrella for anyone. Beautiful umbrella, good quality and perfect size all in this must have item.

I originally bought as a gift for a friend, but since I was in need of travel bag I had to use it and I'm glad I did haha. The first thing I've noticed when the bag arrived is that the quality of leather is great! I've been using for a month now and appearance and quality got better with time , its also soft and flexible. The bag is spacious ideal for travel since has 5 zippered pockets and 2 large compartments, I had no problems bring my laptop with me. Its a versatile bag its spacious and functional.

Nice little bag well made and sharp looking.I am very happy upon receiving this satchel bag. It looks really nice and the quality of the leather and workmanship is superb. The leather is authentic goat skin. I then applied leather protector and it further enhanced the color of the leather. I will buy the black leather next time. Good thing I saw this in Amazon as I was about ready to buy the courier bag from Wilson's leather. Same price but this bag is much much better in terms of its masculine look and function.

I got this headset as a replacement for a different headset I got here on Amazon before this one. The reason I had to replace it so quickly was because of it's horrible performance. Within a week of owning them, the right speaker failed and wouldn't work no matter what I did. Also, for that short time I used them, they were very uncomfortable.<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting this headset, please think again --------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qInCJA<br /><br />The Turtle Beach headset is better and cheaper! I wish I would have just bought this one when I was first looking to upgrade, it would have saved me tons of time and frustration. The sound quality is great and I can wear them for hours on end without a problem. This headset is perfect.<br /><br />I hope I'm able to keep others from making the same mistake I did and just get this pair!

I own a Samsung and was expecting to be let down for the price. I was completely wrong. Actually this RCA has a more natural picture with realistic colors, my new Samsung has cartoonish color quality. I have been trying to get my Samsung, that I paid double for, to look more like this RCA. I found the color adjustment in the Samsung but it goes from not enough color to cartoon quickly in the adjustments. I am completely satisfied with the RCA TV and would happily buy this brand again.

The review here by &#34;P Vo&#34; is pretty much spot in. Having owned this projector myself for some time now, I can agree with most of it. The only really negative thing I can say about it is what he also mentioned about the menus. Yes, it IS like navigating through a maze, lol. But other than that - this is a GREAT projector for your money! I'm using this in its own dedicated movie room, and I have a 110&#34; screen where everything really comes to life.

Decent but the settings for changing the amount of bass could definitely use an improvement, it's great for music but can be a bit too much during some shows. Overall, it's nice and I have always been a huge fan of Samsung (with $1000s worth of their products) but this is one product where I think it would be possible to get a better deal elsewhere without the name. To be fair, I did pay more for mine because I got it in a store, so maybe it's not worth the price I got it for, but I would say around $100 would be a good price for this set up - based on the competition

Good padded section for my laptop, high quality leather, plenty of space, metal button feet to sit on the floor and long zipper tabs to grip easily even if wearing winter gloves.

This TV is by far the best thing I've purchased! I'm very happy with the quality of it. I think so far my favorite thing about it is connecting my phone to it wirelessly and searching YouTube while it plays my TV que. The only thing I didn't like was the mounting instructions. They had all the instructions on how to wall mount it but none on how to mount it on the stand. The pieces weren't labeled so I had no idea what was what but I did eventually figure it out. I've only had a few hours to watch it so I haven't had full pleasure of a lot of the features the TV has to offer. I did however experience the 3D, omg best thing ever!!

Regardless of the other reviews I've read on here, I still took a chance and purchase this watch and I actually love it.  The screen looks very modern and it's a nice size for a watch that can do so much, from texting, playing music, and recording video/audio footage to having wifi and Bluetooth capabilities. It's just like a real phone and I really enjoyed exploring all that this watch can do. I can open up most of my apps on the watch like Twitter and Facebook and I hardly ever have any issues with using them while on the watch. It's pretty durable, I haven't seen any cracks or scratches on it yet and it still looks pretty new.<br /><br />The main thing I love about the watch is how it's compatible with my Adroid phone, that's something that I thought may not be possible. Everything syncs right up and I use it all of the time. Overall, I've had a good experience with it and plan on buying another one as a Christmas gift for my dad.

The only thing I would change, well not change so much as add, is I would add padding on the base of the bag by the wheels so that the leather doesn't get scuffed when the bag is stood up on the wheels. Other than that, I love this style of duffle and plan to get more colors in the near future. Keep up the good work and thanks!

The sound quality is amazing and the overall feel of it is awesome. I got this as an upgrade for for gaming on my PS4 and I have never been so happy!<br /><br />Music sounds great and so do games while using these. The best part is that you can wear them for hours on end without getting sore or uncomfortable. I have had them for over a month and I can't find a single thing to complain about!<br /><br />Sadly I just recently bought a different head before that was absolutely HORRIBLE. One of the speakers would cut out all the time in just two weeks after I bought them. Not to mention a loud rattle noise when you would listen to anything with bass.<br /><br />If you have this headset ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1nsk5ra<br /><br />You need to upgrade as soon as possible.<br /><br />I hope this review helps point people in the right direction, since this headset is the best purchase I've ever made here!

My boys really loved these when they opened them on Christmas morning. We sized them (no trouble at all, easy). But when it came time for each of them to put their watches on, they had an incredibly hard time managing by themselves. One son is 9, the other is 6. Once they were one (with help), the watches snapped themselves off pretty quickly. The clasp piece isn't as secure as I would like, and it came undone when they hit their wrists while playing. One even came undone as my son tried to put his arm into his coat sleeve. I love them because they are so cool, but it's not something they can use every day. I bought http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PIUH1DQ/?tag=zn0-20 because it's better.

If we are talking about LCD HD televisions the only brand that may be considered for me is the LG. I bought my first LG many-many years ago and I have had never problems with this television brand. I wish it will not change in the future. Our family like watching films in the evening together so we have a large one in the living room and 3 smaller in the bedrooms. This version is good for the bedroom according to my opinion.<br /><br />The srceen is very beautiful, the colors are so realistic, the resolution is 1080 pixels. This is more than enough for a home movie watching.

Yes this is refurbished. Yes it works just like the standard brand. But with this one you save $100 over the non-refurbished price tag http://fave.co/1bLffXC  The VIZIO E400I-B2 40-Inch 1080p Smart LED kicks the pants of many LCDs that cost a lot more. Employing minimal zones and actual LEDs (to bring down costs) and much-improved dimming logic, the E series achieves truly remarkable black-level performance. The rest of its picture is also plenty good, and its price is simply phenomenal.  And comparing it to other TV's on the market, Vizio's E series doesn't hold a candle to the picture quality of a great plasma like this one http://fave.co/1c3T3sw  But again, look at that price tag...  Here are the 2 adjustments I'd recommend: --Go to Picture&#62;Advanced Picture then set the BLACK DETAIL to HIGH to get those rich blacks. The default is OFF which I don't understand -- why have a great feature like this then bury it in the settings and turn it off? --Right below Black Detail is BACKLIGHT CONTROL. The default is ON -- turn it OFF. I think it's a mode that saves a tiny bit of power but looks awful with the backlight always fluctuating. It might save 3¢ per month so yeah turn it off.  I like to keep things simple so I found these picture settings to be just dandy: Backlight - 35 Brightness - 35 Contrast - 95 Color - 50 Tint - 0 Sharpness - 50 (Advanced Picture) Color Temperature - Normal Black Detail - High Backlight Control - Off Reduce Signal Noise - Low Reduce Black Noise - Low Film Mode - Auto  OR these settings: Backlight - 50 Brightness - 50 Contrast - 50 Color - 50 Tint - 0 Sharpness - 50 (Advanced Picture) Color Temperature - Normal Black Detail - High Backlight Control - Off Reduce Signal Noise - Low Reduce Black Noise - Low Film Mode - Autoce Black Noise - Low<br />Film Mode - Auto

I was a little reluctant to purchase this, at the time it didn't have any reviews and I hadn't really heard of onesoul as a brand or company. Still, I didn't want to fork out 60 bucks for the Nintendo version.<br /><br />That being said, I tried it out with my Wii U, Smash, and a variety of 4 old and new gamecube controllers I had sitting around and it worked perfectly. Until Nintendo steps it up and starts actually being in stock and not gouging prices for their stuff, this is probably your best bet.

I purchased a XIOS DS Media Play to be able to stream using XBMC from my bedroom TV.  Since the main purpose of the box was to run XBMC, I decided to install the Linux version of XBMC (you will need a micro SD card to update the firmware).  Running Linux XBMC seems to offer a much smoother experience than the android version and is highly recommended.  Installation of 3rd party video addons and the syncing of my media libraries was quite easy.  A keyboard is recommended for the set up process as it would save time (typing network passwords or adding sources).<br /><br />The XIOS plays everything I have in my library without stutter over the network (H.264, WMV, AVI, MKV, MPEG, RMVB, MOV, FLV files up to 1080p over a wired connection).  The box is not your standard plug and play media player and will require a little bit of set up to get the most out of the unit.  However, with instructions for firmware installation and XBMC setup being on the Pivos forums, this was not an issue for me.<br /><br />Very Satisfied... Keep up the good work!

Seriously save some cash and get the http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S8J2BXY<br /><br />SETUP<br />Easy-peasy. Choose language, sign in to network, create an account. Done in 5 minutes.<br />- Minor bug: my wireless network SSID was listed twice.<br />- Minor gripe: had to give my credit card number, but roku.com indicated that I can remove this later via website.<br /><br />USE<br />Overall, the experience is great. The interface is beautiful and easy to navigate. The remote is simple, responsive, and has great range. Previously, I used my Wii to access Netflix, but the remote range was so small that I had to get up off the couch to control the Wii. With the Roku remote I can control things even from the dining room!<br /><br />One potential point of confusion is the integration with M-Go. The top level menu has Channels (Netflix, Amazon, Crackle, etc) AND &#34;Movies&#34;, &#34;TV&#34;, etc. At first I thought that &#34;Movies&#34; might mean all movies across all of Netflix, Amazon, etc, but that's not what it is. The &#34;Movies&#34;, &#34;TV&#34; and other selections are actually sub-headings for M-Go, a new Roku partner. I guess as a partner they get premium placement at the top menu level.

I want to first clarify some points others have been making in the reviews on this TV. It IS indeed 120hz, the person who left that review obviously had no idea what they were talking about. I've seen people dock it stars for the lack of smart functionality. This is not a smart TV. It has a basic,navigable, and responsive menu. I have also seen docked stars for lack of ports. The site plainly lists how many ports the TV has, it's your own fault if you expected it to have more.<br /><br />I have something plugged into every port on this TV, except the USB port (I have no need).<br />Xbox 360 plugged into the Component inputs (old style 360), WD Media Player into 1 HDMI, and a future HDMI cable already run for my future Xbox One. I also have standard coax cable hooked up to this TV as well. This is all I need the TV for, which is why I went with this one vs a TV with more options since budget was an issue.<br /><br />I haven't yet tweaked with the picture settings yet, but plan to and I hope to update this review when I do.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Beautiful display. My friends have commented on it's sharpness, color, and thin bezel. Minimal glare, if any in my setup.<br />-Absolutely perfect response time. I am a very heavy gamer, and this works great for FPS and fast response games. If you plan on using this for any game console, this is your TV.<br />-Absolutely no 'soap opera' effect.<br />-Color and Blacks have been very impressive. My previous LCD LG (i think 09 model) would go to 'lit black' on dark scenes, kind of like an extremely dark grey. I would say this TV is as close to real color and contrast as you can get.<br />-Nice sized remote, not a wii type.<br />-This TV does have a physical power button on the bottom, that is kind of like a joystick you can navigate a mini menu. Cool feature.<br />-Optical out, which I also use with a Soundbar/Wireless sub-woofer.<br />-True 16:9. Fits fully on the screen, no black bars.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Wall mount issues.After having issues with this  http://fave.co/1bADEyN  popular Cheetah mount on Amazon. I ended up getting this one  http://fave.co/1bADIyz  and it went very well. The ports on this TV are basically right in the middle of the back in the TV, right where the brackets for a wall mount go across. The Xbox 360. Coax, and HDMI fit, but BARELY. They are pressed hard into their slots from the bracket of the wall mount, and take hard right angles. Terrible design for the ports, I wish they were the waterfall type.<br />-I expected the built in speakers to be a little better, but I'm being pretty picky here. I only listened for about 10 mins before I hooked up my quality Soundbar just to test.

I saw this tv  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00TRQPSXM  at my local Brandsmart and was impressed; it had perhaps the best picture among standard LED tvs. An LG rep said the LB5800 series use an IPS panel with full array LED backlighting. With help from another Amazon member, we were able to determine the 39&#34; uses an MVA panel, while the 32&#34; uses an IPS panel (see comments). On LG's claim of full array LED backlighting, I assume it's valid, perhaps without local dimming as found on the LB6300 series.<br /><br />I wanted a large screen gaming monitor to sit on my desk. This tv is pretty much all screen so no wasted space. Legs are sturdy, metal with plastic finish. Powered off, the screen is dark and not quite glossy but not quite matte. Colors are bright and vibrant, blacks are deep, screen is bright and uniform. I recommend getting a computer that can use these as it makes everything simple and easy to set up<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B003L1ZYYM<br /><br />As a monitor, the 60hz panel works because input via HDMI from seems limited to 60hz anyway, meaning I could not overclock the 60hz refresh rate using several methods. I suggest not getting hung up on advertised refresh rates though, screen is fast and blurring is minimal even during gaming. TV does have a gaming mode which turns off video processing. While I can't assign a value to input lag, I can say this tv feels more responsive than my old Samsung with no gaming mode. Desktop text is fairly sharp, but doesn't compare to an IPS 1900x1200 monitor.<br /><br />I find these settings optimal for monitor/gaming:<br /><br />backlight = 80<br />contrast = 80<br />brightness = 50<br />color = 50<br />sharpness = 10<br />picture mode = game<br />energy saving = off<br /><br />On general TV functions, menus are easy to navigate, Netflix streaming tuned in at HD with no buffering. Sound is okay, it's bottom firing, with some voice clarity lost behind the screen. Sound bar recommended for best experience. 120 motion index makes movement, especially people moving across screen seem somewhat animated, looks good though.<br /><br />Lastly, LG uses sturdy Styrofoam packing and box material. Box is study, corners hold fast, box center doesn't yield much even with decent pressure applied. Easy assembly and menu config, up and running in under ten minutes.

This eye mask is really good, better than all of the eye masks I have used previously. It is very comfortable and does not let any light in. The material used is really soft, so now I can have a comfortable good night sleep. It uses elastic straps instead of the cheap Velcro, so it doesn't come off while I'm asleep. The lower part of the mask is a little bit thick and heavy, but it causes no problem, instead it prevents any light to enter from the bottom. This mask is more comfortable, more adjustable, more cheaper and blocks more light, than any other Eye mask I have previously used. I actually bought this because I have to fly to Europe from USA, pretty regularly for business, so sometimes i work in the day and sleep in the night, but i had another problem, Jet lag won't let me sleep, so i also bought these  [[ASIN:B00JRMNVRG JET LAG RELIEF - FIGHTS SLEEPLESSNESS - For TRIPS across multiple TIME ZONES - MELATONIN 1mg + L-THEANINE 200 mg and more - 30 SLEEP AID Pills - Get it before a flight to EUROPE, ASIA, AFRICA or AUSTRALIA - Helps regulate CIRCADIAN RHYTHM]] , these pills are really good, they put me to sleep in a few minutes, they contain melatonin, which is good to fight jet lag. These pills+the eye mask, works perfectly for me. Before, when i flew to Europe, i felt really tired because of sleeplessness, but now with these 2 things, i never feel tired after a flight.

This isn't the "nicest" G-Shock available. There are many, more expensive models that come with features like solar charging, radio time-setting, and so on. But honestly, all you really need in a digital watch is toughness, time-telling, and maybe a stopwatch feature. This watch delivers on all those features, and looks pretty cool. I was at a department store and tried to buy a similar watch - they wanted over $100.00 for a watch with the same features as this one. Don't waste your money, this watch has the same basic features, cool look, and legendary toughness of the high-end models for a fair price. The watch is pretty big, but it's lightweight and comfortable to wear. I have very small wrists and the band fits me just fine.

I love the backpack. The style feels so urban, yet rooted. Not everyone will like it though, as I feel it's catered to a certain taste. For them, these leather bags by Rustic Town would have an avant-garde feel. Now coming on to the quality and space. The bag is really spacious. It has a specialized compartment for laptops, which is good. I like the big look of straps as well. To sum it up, the bag looks good on me. It matches well with my 'devil-may-care' attitude (wink wink). Super high-five to the sellers!

I guess I shouldn't be surprised for the price I paid that this set isn't very durable. The zippers and stitching are the problems. We've used the luggage on two trips and the stitching is coming loose in a few spots. The carry on bag my daughter uses more frequently and the outside zipper popped open. I was able to fix it but it won't last. I'll admit she had the compartment overfilled.<br /><br />I wouldn't say don't buy this because it really is a super cute set and a great price. I'd advise to not overfill the compartments and set your expectations that these won't last long if you travel by airplane and check the luggage.

Cool backpack! The delivery is very fast and packaged well. I received it within 3 days after placed the order. It's currently on a BIG SALE, which is amazing!!! The price is sooo.. cheap and it doesn't look cheap. It's perfect for my trip. It holds my books (3-5 pieces), laptop, lunch box and sometimes two t-shirts, all at a time. It doesn't look full and have room to spare. It seems durable and compact. It can withstand quite a lot if heavy items. That's all my expected for a nice backpack less than 20 dollar.  Would recommend it to anyone!

A very impressive little unit.Bought it for my sons birthday so he could play video games with his friends in the basement. Long story short...TV is in the basement and the projector is upstairs now. I really was impressed with the picture quality and the 3D capability. Hilariously, I bought this to save some money rather than buying a new big TV but after playing with it for a while I feel this is really the next wave of home entertainment. I will be buying another one when the time comes. Thanks

Highly reliable and spacious bag at such an affordable price. I bought this to carry my camera but it has enough room to act as a camera+messenger bag. The separate compartments for camera components and lens is a huge advantage in this bag that I found in no other.<br /><br />The leather has an incredibly feeling to it and does not smell at all. The stitching is very firm. I'm glad I bought this bag. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a multipurpose bag.

My son lost his violin bridge and we bought 3 of the 1/2 size. I received the package in two days. My son took the bridge to school and had his techer install it for him. The teacher said it was a nice bridge and wanted to know where I bought it. I was very happy with the teachers review since i have no idea how this things work. Anyway, I've told friend and family about your store. Thank you.

I've had the    http://fave.co/1bQuUp5   for almost a month now and have used it everyday extensively. I give it a solid 5 stars because it admirably performs way above it's price range. A 28 inch LED HDTV at the $200 price level is an amazing accomplishment all on its own. -- The TV has its quirks, some which would cause it to lose a star or two if it was twice the price or more as other brands are for the same thing. And so complaints about the TV in other reviews here are comparable to reviewing a $10K new car and complaining that the power window motor isn't as smooth or powerful as in their $70K Mercedes, and that the engine isn't as smooth and powerful as a car several times its price - or the stereo isn't as fancy, etc. --- This TV is a $200 28 inch LED HDTV - so keep that in context and you'll be amazed by it. The only other TV I would possibly consider at this price point would be the    http://fave.co/1bQvjb5  The picture is absolutely perfect - high-def sharp - the colors are all perfect with no video distortions anywhere across the entire screen. The complaints about this TVs audio is really strange, because the audio is quite good - much better than I would expect for such a low priced TV. -- I suppose if you put this TV in a large living room - viewing it from 14 to 16 feet away, then the audio may not be perfect for that application.  The overall aesthetics of the TV are also quite impressive - very sleek with a thin black border frame, sitting on a wide stable stand that is one of the best designs for a TV stand I've ever seen - placing the TV low to surface it is sitting on - making it very secure on its feet - instead of the way its done on almost all other TVs; stupidly stuck up in the air on some spindly center pole.  The inputs on this TV are indeed limited. It doesn't have three or four of every input imaginable. Instead, it has two HDMI inputs, one component input, one VGA (RGB-PC) input for your computer, and a 75 ohm cable input. As far as which HDMI cables to use I recommend amazon's very own    http://fave.co/1bQuuPE  That's it, but if you need more than that, then you should be prepared and willing to spend a lot more than $200. --- I use my E280-B1 for both a TV and a computer monitor and I am very impressed with its performance as a computer monitor. A 28 inch dedicated computer monitor costs twice as much as this TV, yet this TV outperforms all the dedicated hi-def digital computer monitors I've had - very impressive indeed.  There are some quirks. The earphone audio output comes from the factory at a unusably low audio level, which is unaffected by the volume control. To make the earphone jack useful, you need to go into the Menu - choose &#34;Audio&#34; and then &#34;Analog Audio Out&#34; and change that setting from &#34;Fixed&#34; to &#34;Variable&#34; -- back out of the menu and your earphone jack in now useful and controlled by the TVs volume control. - And the remote control is much smaller than other remotes, so it takes some getting used to before it feels comfortable to use. The RC being small takes away space that could have been used to include the four main input selections as dedicated buttons - instead of having to go into &#34;Input&#34; each time and scroll to choose the one you want. Other than these quirks, the TV is most definitely as good as it gets - and much more - for a $200 TV.  It deserves 4.9 stars, but since there is no such rating, rounding to the nearest whole number gives it 5 stars. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone needing a hi-def TV for a small room or their office to be used as a TV and monitor - because you get way more than what you paid for.....  In the end I recommend the    http://fave.co/1bQuUp5

I have a guest room bracket-mounted TV and the speakers were shot and crackling - I wanted to fasten a soundbar to the set and turn off the TV's worn out speakers - problem was I had to plug the soundbar into an outlet somewhere and did not want to see the power cord hanging down from what is a neat and clean install. The InstaOutlet solved the problem. Advertised for adding Roku or Apple TV to a wall mount (doesn't matter - it gave me the outlet I needed behind the TV) and let me hide the power and connection wires. Very well made and did the job great. Definite recommend for any need like mine or anything else you want to add to wall mounted TV.

Pros:<br />-The best looking G-Shock and digital watch I could find, period. Worth spending $130 (what I paid in 10.2011) just for the look. Looks bad-ass, manly, and heavy duty. You are no doubt to attract glances from everyone around you. I got compliments from women and friends who usually criticize my style.<br />-There is no unnecessary flash, so can wear at the gym or more formal occasions.<br />-This is a man's watch and makes every other G-Shock look either hideous or as a cheap toy. If Batman wore a watch, this would be it.<br />-The home screen is well utilized - every pixel has a purpose.<br />-Very light and fits comfortably. Not too big - just perfect. However, it's not comfortable to sleep with it on, so I take it off at night.<br />-Solar charging is a big plus. Battery lasts 9 months on full charge without any exposure to sunlight. No need to change or worry about the battery. Ever. It conserves light by shutting off the display at night, which turns back on the moment you pick it up in the morning.<br />-Stopwatch, timer, and five alarms with one snooze are very useful. I especially use the snooze option to remind me to take my medication at the same time each day. I do, however, wish there was a vibrate option (like the newer GD350, which was released Feb 2013).<br />-Can see (a pre-set) second timezone at the press of a button.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No seconds adjustment in timer, only minutes. I need to set intervals for doing sets while working out, and I wish to be able to adjust the timer to the second (like 1min 30sec).<br />-Stopwatch is very elementary, whereas it has a lot more potential given the three-line display. Unlike the G7700 (which utilizes its 3-line displays perfectly), it only shows elapsed/split times (which even cheap digital watches do).<br />-Alarm is too quiet, I wish there was a volume adjust setting. I often miss it at the gym when timing my sets, and I don't even bother relying on it to wake me up.<br />-The light stays on too briefly, for about 1.5 sec. I wish I could adjust the duration of the backlight to set it to 2-3 seconds (the newer GD350 has 1, 3, and 5 second light options).<br />-Atomic timekeeping hard to get in SF area (Notice, the G9200 does not have atomic timekeeping).<br />-I never use the barometer (although the barometer display is cool to look at), thermometer, or altimeter (which is inaccurate, because its reading is based on the barometer). Thermometer is not reliable - off by up to 10 degrees Fa (have to take it off for at least 5 minutes to get accurate reading). Also, too much scrolling through the barometer, altimeter, and the altimeter-record functions (like 7 or 8 for full cycle).<br />-No compass... in case of a zombie apocalypse, you know.<br /><br />Overall, the best-looking digital watch you can find. However, I can do without the barometer and altimeter (and maybe even the atomic timing). I'd like it to have the option for a vibrator alarm and to be able to adjust the timer to the second.

Ive used this bag for two trips so far, and I have no real complaints yet. I bought it to use for frequent international travel. So far, it has shown no signs of damage. The only thing that was surprising is that one of the sides is not reinforced - It just kind of bulges if you have too much stuff or you can push the fabric in. I guess its just one less thing to break, but I found that odd.

First off, I upgraded from an Insignia 24&#34; LED 1080p seen here http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B005TNRM8Q This TV is trip to the moon difference better from the Insignia, Can't go wrong, I have it on the wall and the sound is great, I am not using it for my entertainment system, it's a dining room addition.  Colors are vibrant, blacks are what they need to be, black. Timer to set up the auto power on and off is great.  I had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B000WYVBR0  Tried different angles and the viewing was good or excellent in almost all. Samsung for some reason have this idea to have a light in their T.V's front side when they are off. this one has a little red light that does not bother me at all. Other Samsung TV I have has a giant blue light that it is annoying if you have the T.V in the bedroom. why they add this lights is a mystery to me you know when the T.V is off and On, has image TV ON, Not image TV is OFF, as simple as that.  Some people also complain that this is not the thinnest T.V either well unless you are going to set it in a razor thin wall the difference between 3.5&#34; and 1.5&#34; in back space is meaningless. the deep unless you have serious space problems is useless the wide distance is in the back and you are looking at the screen from the front so who cares? I understand the difference with old TV's and the bulky back side. Having 3.5&#34; against 1.5&#34; for more $100? give me the cheaper 3.5&#34; and $100 back in my bank account.  Because i am not using any external sources of sound and care too much about that in the bedroom I did not care as much about the lack of outputs for headsets or even speakers like some people in these reviews seem to care so much but if you do it is something to consider. This is the best TV for the price TV for these usages:  1. Bedroom T.V / Kids room. 2. Kitchen T.V 3. To be used as a monitor if your computer HAS a HDMI connection 4. if you use your TV ata regular volume and don't care about external sources of sound.(Speakers, headsets, sound bars). 5. You have a cable box or signal source which native resolution is 720p if you pay the extra for the 1080p the T.V image wont be any better unless you watch blue rays in a blue Ray capable DVD (Timer Warner boxes for instance have a native resolution of 720p). 6. You don't want to break the Bank to have a good quality T.V mostly for regular T.V viewing. 7. Want a flat panel too replace that old bulky TV a flat panel that is it not as thin as a sheet of paper but thinner than old TV's you want to replacement (My case). 8. Don't mind that the ports are in the back (Again except for some TV's where the ports are on the side you usually get them in the back) Save $50 and get the http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSFVSMS

You really can't go wrong with the Samson C01U. It's an incredibly durable mic with a very high standard of functionality and ease of use. Definitely worth the money if you are using it for voiceovers, singing/rapping, or commutation in online games and programs such as skype. I feel this is much better for vocals as opposed to instruments, though I have much more experience with using it for vocals - so take this last sentence with a grain of salt. I haven't used the program that it comes with, Cakewalk Sonar, as I directly use the mic in programs such as Fruity Loops and Ableton where I have mixing plugins available - so I cannot vouch for how good the program is but I can say that it works great with the popular audio creation programs and it is VERY simple to set up - just plug it in and go to your settings of your workspace and active it.<br /><br />Overall, it's definitely worth it. I would give it an 8/10<br /><br />(I think there may also be this same microphone being offered by Samson with a free pop filter and some other goodies, I would suggest that if you don't need Cakewalk)

Great projector at a cheap price. You can easily get other projectors that can compare to this but it will be somewhat more expensive. This projector displays the images from your computer, your movie player or whatever you may desire very well in high definition. For this price, I don't think anyone could complain about the projector because it is definitely the bang for the buck projector. Anyone wanting a high quality projector for a decent price should buy this one definitely.<br /><br />I have one myself and I enjoy it on the regular, I watch my TV shows, movies and YouTube videos on here all the time. I have to say I am very pleased with it. I use it for my home theater as well. I connect it to my computer and it shows very high definition display in comparison to my old projectors. I am very pleased on how quality this projector is. As mentioned above, I would recommend this projector for anyone who wishes to purchase a projector that is definitely the bang for the buck (worth the money).

We have a small 10'x12' game room for our Xbox 360 and Wii U. Each console is hooked up to a LG 47&#34; LED TV. The video quality is fantastic but the sound left a lot to be desired. This &#34;problem&#34; needed a solution.   I set four simple goals to address this.  1) The system had to sound great. 2) High Wife Acceptance Factor. :) 3) I did not want to run a separate A/V receiver. I simply don't have the room. 4) I did not want to run wires under the baseboards or carpet.  To achieve these goals I decided to build a complete Sonos Home Theater System, with the new PLAYBAR front and center (literally).  Here are the components I chose for my system:  - Sonos BRIDGE - Sonos PLAYBAR - Sonos SUB - Sonos PLAY:3 (x2 as Surround Speakers)  Let's start with the setup. First thing I did was download the Sonos software for my laptop and hooked up the Wireless BRIDGE to my router. After the software downloaded and installed, getting the BRIDGE recognized by the software was as simple as pressing a button.

I like that this tv is so affordable and samsung is always been good qualtiy for our upgrades.  Only negative is, picture w/o HD broadcast is not so great, a little less clear  I got spoiled easily with the HD picture!!! Still have to get our HD receiver w/ Direct TV. We did watch the Super Bowl in HD and it was amazing!!! Amazon shipped it quickly too!!! Would definately recommend this TV.Very happy with this HDTV, excellent value. Easy to set up and use.

Just received the it and tested it. It works great with my smart phone.The web browser on this box is really fast.  Once you've figured out how to install your favorite add-ons in XBMC your good to go, cancel your cable!  I've already watched so many HD movies and sports my cable's been turned off for a month,  I'm never going back. What's great about this is you don't have to be a computer geek to make this box work,  a little XBMC research and you'll be good to go.  This box is also rooted so you can unplug it and move it where ever you want without losing your settings, I have my box 20 feet from my router and the Q box says it's receiving 75mbs over wi-fi .  You have to have a strong data connection to make these boxes work like they should,  so if you have limited data service or weak data connection, than this might not work well for you. I had to upgrade my router 70 bucks, and my cable modem 80 bucks to get the speed right. Awesome box would highly recommend it to anybody takes some getting use to but well worth the price.

Great Blu-ray player..... This player is very much like the former model, however with more graphics on the menu screen its great for me and my family. Loading takes a couple of seconds, but it isn't too horrible because you get what you pay for.. Wi-fi works great and was a breeze to setup unlike a lot of bluray pplayers. Movies look great on here as you feel like your inside the movie. ! Many Blu-ray players tout a 100+ streaming apps, but this one actually delivers all of them instantly. I am a big fan of sony products and the company, i have no issues with their customer service either!

Choosing a good traveling bag for me has been a great challenge until I tried out on this lovely and amazing duffel bag,it is the latest bag that I have completely fallen for it and I regularly used it for my weekend trips or during my vacation and every member in my family owns it and they like it great deal,they are good bags for keeping belongings close to your hands.<br /><br />This tote bag comes with a very strong leather handle which makes it easy to carry the bag around with you even if loaded with luggage, my children enjoy this bags so much that I have no stress of misplacing their belongings whenever we are on a family trip,they just love taking it by themselves. It is a bag which makes traveling so enjoyable and easy and provides maximum security.<br /><br />The good things about the duffel bag is that it is an air compatible bag and has a good design with reflects which makes it easy for one to identify it and the price is amazing,very pocket friendly but only the thing not perfect is that the bag should have spinner wheels which make it more easy to move around.

If you're anything like me you see that this TV is labeled as LED; then you look at the picture and see a lot of fat for the usual Samsung LED depth. Make no mistake this is an LED TV. I got this for my bedroom to replace my 23 inch Samsung Syncmaster. It is great for the price and I'd recommend it. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00C18YRSA  I use this TV mostly for 1080 mp4 movies and blurays (I download what I want to watch instead of waiting for it on cable), and my Xbox and PS3.  Long story short, Comcast had me thinking I purchased my first dud from Samsung. Seriously, the colors look washed out and none of the channels really had that crisp clear picture I was hoping for. If you plan to use this solely for Comcast, I can't really recommend it. In fact, I've always found blu ray quality to be so much better than cable that I've stopped using cable for anything but football and cartoons. Movies MUST be in my PS3's blu ray player or my own 1080p files.  I learned 2 things about the TV right off the bat. If you have Comcast, you cannot fully customize the TV's picture. An essential feature called HDMI black levels actually looks much better when its set to low. I have 2 different Comcast HD boxes and since neither of them broadcast at 1080, this feature is locked out.  I had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B000WYVBR0  The second thing I learned about is what the depth is for. Samsung didn't advertise this (or maybe its just my TV), but I have absolutely NO BACKLIGHT BLEED. When Black Ops goes to the loading screen on my Xbox, it gets so dark that I think the TV is off! The only indication that it is on is the Black Ops logo in the corner spinning. There isn't even the SLIGHTEST inkling of white anywhere! I'm not exaggerating. The obvious second reason why this TV is fat for an LED is that Samsung made an effort to improve the sound. When I turn on the HD surround coupled with the movie option, there is much more bass than I thought it would be. THe explosions in my games and the soundtracks in movies sound vastly better than I thought they would. Granted, I am not the type to go out and spend 600 on some Bose speakers, but the sound is NOT a con for me this time around.  NOW ON TO THE PICTURE  As I said, I was not exactly thrilled with the picture RIGHT off the bat. It looked like my old 23 inch Syncmaster, just a lot bigger. Let me tell you, this is not one of those TV's that look great right out of the box. You have to toy around with the settings a bit to get the optimal picture. I wanted sharpness coupled with colors that pop like crazy.....and I got it. Dynamic is the brightest setting, but I coupled this with the HDMI black levels set to low (option not available for Comcast cable box) and voila, moving photographs! I'm not a pro but this is my setup:  Mode: Dynamic Backlight: 18 Contrast: 85 Brightness: 50 Sharpness: 80 Color: 70 TInt: G/R 50/50 Standard color tone with screen fit in the additional options, with HDMI black level set to low.  My games and blurays look AMAZING. The picture is easily better than my mom's 46 inch Samsung up front. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0071NWYP8  REMEMBER that some of the good options are cut off from Comcast and the use of component cables. In games, I do have to up the brightness or gamma a little, but it ends up looking BRILLIANT. I am going through my entire library of games and they feel like entirely new experiences! There is a 32 inch 720p option as well, but I just was not comfortable with 720p max. The new game consoles are gojng to have native 1080 so that's what I wanted. BTW did I mention I'm a big gamer?  THE CONS  WITH A COMCAST CABLE BOX I could see no difference between HDMI and component. I kept switching back and fourth, but since the max output is 1080i, there were no differences in picture.  Well I saw this TV up on Amazon before it was on Samsung's website. Yeah, WOW. Sometimes I wanted to see the TVs specs from Samsung directly before I made my buy. Make no mistake this is NOT a 120 HZ tv although it is labeled as one. I have no idea what clearmotion 120 is, but it makes my TV much darker. The feature is entirely useless and does nothing to the picture or add the &#34;soap opera&#34; effect like I had hoped (it looks great for games).  VERDICT  With a lot of tweaking, I got the picture to look beautiful. I will use my Comcast box sparingly, but I might move to FIOS if the support full 1080. Watching movies on my PS3 and playing games on my Xbox stopped me from returning the TV. I will not be surprised if this set gets bad reviews from Comcast users (even though Its not Samsung's fault). I'm a &#34;videophile&#34; and this passed my personal test with vibrant colors.  In the end get yourself one of these http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S5MBB1C

I love all the compartments and how easily it is to get to things, usually with just one hand. You don't need to undo the clasps to get to your laptop or tablet just unzip the back compartment. I have the small version and travel with a 13in Macbook Pro, notebooks, chargers, umbrella, and there is still room for a water bottle and airport food and being able to tighten up the strap keeps it from swinging around when you walk through tight spaces.

Being that I only really purchase Sony televisions, picking the brand of blu-ray player was simple.   Sony  Sony has finally provided a Blu-Ray DVD player for dedicated Sony users. The player itself is incredibly lightweight. The top of the player has a small touchpad that allows you to control the player easily in-case you lose the remote. The remote is standard as far as Sony products go. If you're unfamiliar with Sony electronics: all remotes works for all products.  That means this remote works for my television as well as the blu-ray player. And, indeed, this was the case. I use it with this awesome TV http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00HPMCNXI  PERFORMANCE The (high definition) Blu-ray movies played on the DB-D5500 are fabulous. (Standard low definition) DVDs are much clearer than played on my old DVD player. Nothing more needs to be said.  PROS/CONS 1) The BD-D5500 has a loading tray, which encourages proper handling of the disks by the edges. (Many more expensive players are &#34;slot loading&#34;) 2) The controls are touch (not buttons)---sometimes a quick tap is good enough, sometimes it is not. I greatly prefer the tactile feedback of buttons. I find it very annoying that if I tap too quickly, nothing happens; if I tap too slowly, it &#34;double-reads&#34;, e.g. &#34;open-close&#34; and never opens; or &#34;on-off&#34; and never turns on. Note that &#34;tactile feedback&#34; could be supplied by a built-in clicker that you would both hear and feel---simple cheap technology. 3) Although I don't need it, I think that it is absurd that the optional wireless adapter costs as much as the player, when Sony could surely build-it-in for $5 more. 4) Sometimes the player remembers where you paused a movie, sometimes it doesn't. 5) Despite the complaint of one reviewer, it is the standard width (17&#34;), exactly the same as my old DVD player and my receiver. 6) The controls are illuminated, and so, easy to operate even in a dark room, but the controls are identified only by symbols. Seeing in the dark is good, feeling in the dark would be even better---that is, with my old Sony DVD player, the button on the far left was on/off, the button on the far right was open/close---so I did not even have to look at the panel to know what button to push. In my opinion the Sony was more ergonomically designed.  If you're hot to trot, like I was use Amazon Prime's 30 day free trial. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00EW0FYA0 In the end if you get this, you'll be pleased http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00TYFCJOM

I wanted a good TV for my PS3 so I could play my Skyrim video game, I can actually read the signs on the game when my character is running down the roads on the game! Fantastic compared to the last 32&#34; TV I bought last year that blew a fuse within the 90 days. I am watching this Netlix show and I am just amazed with the clarity. Great gaming, Netflix, Youtube viewing and...the sound is great for a small bedroom (I'm on a lower setting for the room 14 level and it's not even a quarter up the volume level). Good stuff, thank you LG for helping me get my video game action on during my school break and yes, when I play video games it's all for research :)...

One of the best products I've ordered for our church kiosk. In use now for a few years with no problems whatsoever. I'm just amazed at complexity within this little box that offers so much; sd/hd, usb, nice easy menus, remote, ext drive capable, etc, etc, etc. The only thing I would like to see is a network interface capability. If this box could look like a node, we could update it remotely without having to bring in a revised sd card or flash drive. That would be the coolest feature ever....to be able to simply send it a new video file and have it play.

Happy Birthday to Me, Happy Birthday to....  After &#34;suffering&#34; through life with a measly 42&#34; 720P Plasma, http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BB1C140  I decided to up my game so to speak. As my birthday was a approaching, I needed no more justification. Of course, Amazon'a great price certainly posed no additional barriers, so I was set.  Now before you think that I spontaneously jumped into this purchase on a whim, let me set the record straight. I've been researching an LED/LCD alternative to my Plasma &#34;toaster&#34; for quite some time. In addition to energy efficiency, I was also looking for 1080P resolution, 60&#34; - 70&#34; in size(my wife wouldn't let me go bigger), reliability, and of course price.   I narrowed my search down to Samsung and Vizio and Vizio presented the best value, and Amazon offered the best price. Here were the other two I was looking at: http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00ID2HGQ8 http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00GTE0VJ6  As for the TV, the picture is great, even better after some tuning and using it is a breeze. I ran the HDMI cable to my surround sound receiver, and made a couple of adjustments and now I use one remote for all devices. About the only negative isn't with the TV at all, but with the LED/LCD platform itself. It turns out that the viewing angle of these TVs is a lot narrower than a Plasma TV, so you need to sit close to the middle to get the best picture. That doesn't mean that everyone has to crowd onto the sofa, it just gets &#34;cloudy&#34; when you are way to the side.  The sound is fine. It's not spectacular and I don't know how it could be given the thickness of the TV. I don't notice it as any worse than my previous flat panel (LCD, 8 years old). My setup is such that I watch regular TV using the built in speakers then use my 2.1 stereo setup for movies, music videos or concerts, etc. However, the built in speakers a just fine for everyday watching.  All in all, I am very happy with my purchaseand the TV. I highly recommend this TV and Amazon/. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SMBG0S0

I bought this to go in my garage. I tested it inside first and it looked amazing. Really clear and looked good even with well lit room. My neighbor saw it and was really impressed with the clarity. After installing it in the garage it looked good out there too! around noon with the garage door open sunlight dilutes the picture, but other than that it's great. That amount of sun made my HDTV hard to see outside as well. My dad saw it and wants to get one as their main living room TV. I want another one for inside as well.

I am a frequent traveler so I really only use an eye mask when I'm on a plane and trying to get some rest. I hate it when the person next to me has their light on and I'm trying to sleep! So I saw the great reviews for this eye mask and thought I'd try it out. I went to Rome last month and used it for the flight over and had a really good rest. It could also be that I tried out this new product I found [[ASIN:B00JRMNVRG JetFighter Sleep - Jet Lag Relief - Fights Jet Lag Symptoms Like Sleeplessness and Disturbed Sleep - 30 Sleep Aid Pills - Non Homeopathic - Contains Melatonin - Made in the USA]] which knocked me right out. Anyway, they work really well together. The mask drowned out all of the light and was comfortable enough to wear for the entire 9 hour flight. The material is really comfortable and the band in the back wasn't too restrictive. Overall I am very pleased with my eye mask and would definitely recommend it to others.

This transfer pump is not for automotive.<br />Its too big and bulky.<br />Hard to move around. Thick tubing is ok, but it comes bent so liquid doesn't flow thru bent areas.<br />Hard to suck liquid, but eazy to pump out.<br /><br />Refilling transmission fluid was much labor intensive and had spills allover.<br /><br />Will not recommend this for any automotive use, unless dealing with large quantities of liquid such as Semi Trucks or a Train perhaps ?

It works well but you need something like a fine tip permanent marker to write on it.  Luckily I have plenty of these.

Much better than using sticky notes which don't stick well in the freezer.

The VIZIO S5430W-C2 54-Inch 3.0 Soundbar is a fantastic sound bar.  This is made for &#34;bigger&#34; TVs and bigger rooms.  Therefore, make sure you have the space for it before purchasing.  We've previously had Samsung and another Vizio sound bars (either sold or broken), but this one is so above and beyond those ones.  It's a bit pricier than the shorter models, so make sure you can justify your purchase before diving in.

We bought this and it was missing two support pieces, so we had to return it and get a better brand.  It's one thing to have your product made in China to save on costs, it's another to let your quality control go to zero: this company shipped out the box with several parts missing.

It takes many weeks for carrot seeds to germinate. They can be soaked in water and sowed outdoors for accelerating the process. Germination rate may be poor, so a lot of seeds need to be sown. In cold weather areas, they can be sowed after all danger of frost is gone. Carrots take up to three months to produce fruits. The whole plant is edible.<br /><br />Rabbits will possibly appear in any carrot garden.

Good soundtrack, had variety, one of the tekkens with an actual plot(3 4 and 5 were slightly plot heavy)<br />this period in time tekken was great, had that underground dark atmosphere than when 6 came(best combat)but 6 was brighter in comparison regarding tone and storytelling, which in 6 was ridiculous.

These candles are attractive and function well.  The real wax on the outside make them less obviously battery operated. Because they are made of real wax, I was able to shave down the back side of one of them so it would fit into a candle holder/lantern with a small opening/door.  Great to have candles on top of a bookcase that I don't need a ladder to light and don't pose a fire hazard.

Although I like how thick and creamy this lotion is, I'm not a big fan of the scent. It is semi overpowering. It smells good, but it's just too much.

I usually feed them a half cup a day (divided into two 1/4-cup servings), mixed with about 1/4 cup of water (a thinner oatmeal-like consistency). I like how it's made it real ingredients and is grain-free. I usually buy it at our local pet store where a 4LB box is around $30 or so.

Excellent kit. It comes with a daily use cleaner/polisher, and wax polisher for a once per month or so heavier polishing, and a cloth to perform both. I've used this on both acoustic and electric guitars and it keeps both of them looking shiny and smooth. I highly recommend this kit to all guitarists, as it only sounds as good as it looks :-}

The coasters are really great at soaking up the water from a glass. As for the colors, yes, they are a little more pink and somewhat purple than the picture shows, but still very nice. I am baffled as to why they aren't shipped with any padding in between the coasters (they are just in a box). A couple of them have small chips, but not enough to go through the hassle of sending them back.

These are the most beautifully colored beads!  The two tone beads are fuchsia and lemon with hues of pinks because of an ombre effect.  They have a lovely shine from the Czech Fire Polish.  These beads are on the smaller side (6mm), and there are 25 beads in an order.  High quality, beautiful beads....I recommend them.

Works well for small dogs and puppy. Our dog is pomeranian. Keeps her safe and secure when we leave home knowing she can't get out and get into anything.

For what this is designed for.  Sticking Foam onto the walls.......this works fantastic.<br /><br />Sprayed on the back of the Auralex Foam and waited about ten seconds, and they stuck the foam on the wall and held it for about 10 seconds.  Solid!  Using this in a home recording studio and have not tried to remove so not sure how that will work.

Absolutely in love! Everything I hoped for and more! My other wedding ring set was starting to tarnish after 2 weeks of getting married, so my husband bought this for me. Shows my Irish heritage and hasn't tarnished or caused any rash. If you're allergic to gold, white gold, sterling silver, etc, like myself, I recommend this! It's hypoallergenic and absolutely perfect!! It's so shiny also! (: very pleased!

It seems the netting on pool skimmers last only about 2 years and then dry rot. I am hoping this lasts longer but we shall see. It ius a little narrower then my old skimmer and fits very snugly on the pole but works just fine. It has a steel reinforcement around the plastic border so that part should hold up fine. The price was good and it was delivered fairly quickly.

Excellent to place under a rack to keep it from sliding around you will need to use tie downs to the vehicle though, not tie downs to the rack.  The suction cups do not have a great deal of suction, I was trying to build a custom GPS mount and the suction cup does not work as well as most GPS suction cups.

My benchmark for cutters is a standard metal clothes hanger.  With regular snips I've always had to squeeze, twist, squeeze, twist and then end up bending it back and forth to break it.

For its time, this was probably quite a shocker and explored some territory that we were not used to seeing in film:  lesbians in a relationship and in the world of sports.<br /><br />The two weak points for me were Hemingway, who was not such a great actress; and the fact that the movie seemed to drag on much longer than it needed to.

They also have more omega threes than the large version I was taking.

These ice scraping mitts are quite nice. The ice scrapers themselves are solidly built and not at all flexible or flimsy. The mitts are very soft and warm. The waterproof mitt has the added bonus of being able to wipe off rain covered windows as well. I loved that it came in a two pack. One for my car and one for my husbands and since they are different colors, he can't run off with mine!

These are pretty basic; Ni-MH pre-charged batteries.  They've recently changed the look of them, as they used to be encased in a black wrapper, and now it's white.

Bought to do bed lighting in my truck. Works really well, easy to trim to length. The adhesive does not hold up well at all especially of left in the heat. Applied a bead of silicone adhesive under it and holds up very well. They are plenty bright for my application but not super bright. Leaves kind of a blue/purple light, not bright white.

Vanessa did all the pre-assembly in the garage. I built the base out of 12 foot 4x4s covered with 8 foot 2x10's to include a ramp. Assembly is pretty easy.

Excellent product. I used it for my mahogany dining set, which was not in bad shape, but a little dry and pale. I only used about 1/4 of the bottle for the table and 6 wood chairs, and they look great. Easy to apply, and not difficult to remove, using a microfiber cloth. Then it keeps drying out slowly until the greasy touch dissapears, but the shinning remains.

If you want to install a snap-lock or quick lock on it (which I always do), it's not easy because it's pretty thick. Otherwise it's far better than most straps out there.

Holds data and is a great size for in your car. If you want it to serve as bootable media for installing an OS, look elsewhere as SanDisk forces it to be seen as a hard drive versus a removable device. You can make it work with the right tools but it doesn't work well. For music in the car, it's great.

I love this.  We're at the beach 1-2 times a week and this is so great to throw wet and sandy toys in.  It's really wide and holds a lot but the sides aren't very high so toys fall out if tips over or if I bend over.

I loved the untoasted version of this particular coconut, so thought the toasted type would be fun. But, the flakes are a bit tough. Just not nearly as nice as I expected.

This is made very cheaply.  It feels like a toy and I wouldn't trust it to zap my dog safely.  Luckily, the one we received was not functional at all.  So, we never used it.  But, even if it had worked, I would have been hesitant to use it after seeing how awful it was made.

Pretty tasty treat, but not very spicy (needless to say, it didn't kick my @$$ at all). It's a tad pricey for a relatively small product.

Great period piece and a unique tale of Queen Elizabeth. Shows Queen Elizabeth as a young girl before her queenhood all the way up to her death.

We homeschool and use a trapper keeper to store all our worksheets. I copy them over summer and put them into the trapper as a large workbook to cut down prep time during the school year because my husband and I both work. However little hands (and elbows) are constantly tearing them out accidentally.  These little gems work perfectly and we could not do without them!

The design is smart, they are very spacious, but the cardboard only goes halfway on each shelf which is weird and makes it not appear as strong as things in the back sag.

I like that it velcros over the rod, makes it easy to customize the fit and move around easily.

I bought this as a Valentine's gift for my two girls.  I thought that they would come apart so each girl could have one.  Well, they are attached to each other with knots of thread.  I used a seam ripper and detached them. I did keep the thread holding the hands together.  That way, the monkeys could still wrap there arms around each other to hug. Really cute, and my girls love them.

The shoe does not have the support it advertises. The shoes looks nice but are deceiving. As someone who depends on good shoes for long hours of wear, I would rate these a 1. The shoe bed feels cushy at first, but feels non-existent after a couple of hours. They are not suitable for long term wear. I will not buy any Walking Cradles again.

A good size that fits comfortably in the tool section of the plastic box, but is comfortable to hold. It cuts threads cleanly without snagging fabric (if I'm careful). Unfortunately, this seam ripper and I have spent a lot of time together correcting mistakes. ;-)

Luckily our baby didn't care what kind of nipple we gave her- so we actually use 2 different Avent nipples.

Undeniably, this is, by far and away, the BEST fruitcake you will ever eat!  My family has a long history of purchasing fruitcakes from Assumption Abbey, and we just won't be without them at Christmas.  They are unbelievably delicious, and in my &#34;less than humble&#34; opinion, there isn't a fruitcake in the country that even comes close to tasting as good as these do.  Order -- and enjoy!!!

It DOES work in very certain circumstances.  You have to know what your doing with this stuff because the cream is abrasive.  The idea is that you buff out big scratches with smaller scratches.  If you don't use it right, it will ruin your discs.  If you do use it right, it can save them.  Better instructions could help this product a lot!

didn't even know there was a different sand paper required for removing paint, so I've learned something new.

These are the same jars as the ones that accompanied my blender.  The utility of having 3 jars over just one improves my flexibility of having one or more users prepare their shakes.

I ordered two of these. One in each size. First ordering the small one. After seeing what it did to my cupboard I bought the large one too. The two of them on the same shelf leave about 4" of space between them. Perfect for a couple larger and taller containers. People seeing my cupboard are jealous of my organization. For the cost of these they are must haves for all kitchens. Big or small.

After a year of on again off again very light use this knife simply doesn't hold up well.  I am mostly referring to the steel quality of the blade.

As with most of Gerber's Chinese made products the design is there but the execution is terrible.

We will have these at hand when the weekly crossword arrives. Nice that the lead is advanced by a twist of the &#34;nozzle&#34; rather than a click at the top.

I've used numerous brands of lens and other similar products over the years, and find this 'kit' an excellent place to begin accumulating items that a photographer might and will need over time.<br /><br />My only complaint is the reversible hood.

This can be corrected when editing afterwards, but robs a wide-angle lens of its functionality.

My dog loves these.  They are the perfect size for her.  We have probably gone through 6 of this very one (along with a bunch of other nylabones).

She's adorable chewing on them- she holds them upright between her paws.  I highly recommend these!

The knife is a lot bigger and bulkier than I thought. Seems built well and pretty stable. No loose parts or wiggles of the blade. This is not something I would carry in my pocket everyday.

This is exactly the same down to the make, size, and specs. And install is just pull two small electrical wires and re-attach to the new unit and you’re done.

This was a pretty good mount for the low price. It's flexible in terms of mounting options and projectors with which you could use it. That said, it could've been made out of heavier-duty metal.

Worked nice in the garage for a cold Halloween. I was worried it would get hot above the unit, but the shield is fantastic. I would NOT recommended letting this stand in open wind without building your own base for it. The top part will definitely work like a sail in the wind.

Piece of junk.  A month after I bought it the plastic piece that houses the 30-pin connector came unglued.  I snapped it back together, but the connecter was still a little wobbly.  A week or two later, the ground wire came loose from the connector so now it won't charge at all.

This is great for lower back pain. The only problem is that the inner plastic bag shrinks up after using the heater function.Then you have to stretch the bag back to original shape.

Finally a well made product that has a price within the average Joe's budget. Swiss made quality craftsmanship, no battery to worry about and has a two year warranty. After purchasing attractive watches in the three hundred dollar range that have disappointed this buyer with quartz battery issues, this watch is well worth paying double for an automatic mechanism. I hope that it will last for many years!

This soil tester seems to be fairly accurate, at least over the few times I've used it.

This is a good, solid oil that is packaged well.  The jug has a pull-out spout built in that makes it much easier to pour directly into the engine.  That spout can twist making it hard to remove or tighten the cap sometimes, but i'll take it for the advantage of not needing a funnel.

I did not note wobble, as some others have.  Obviously, this is intended for shooting in a more stable environment but I use it on the end of my Gorilla pod.  I did have a little bit of loosening at the tripod screw so if I decide to use this setup again for mobile shoots, I will probably utilize a steel cable tether, just to make sure I don't loose my GoPro.

At first my greyhound didnt take to this toy but after he heard the (very) faint squeaker inside, he grew to love it. We use it to throw in the backyard. Since it's oddly shaped, it bounces all over the place when it lands and he loves that.

I selected this product as a present for my nephew. I purchased an Airsoft Gun and these BBs.

I didn't find that to be the case, or if there was a price difference it was only slightly higher. I would recommend this product.

I bought this mount for my 32&#34; TV in my 5th wheel.  This is a pretty heavy duty mount but still metric bolts and screws.  Mounted on 1 and a half inch of ply wood, glued, screwed to the wall and anchored into the so called studs in the walls. The mount does exactly what we intended and extends far enough out of the old coovy hole so everyone can see the TV..

I'm so glad Nintendo finally released a licensed clear 3DS cover! This case is amazing. It's on the softer side so it's flexible and easy to put on (and it stays on!). It is completely transparent so if you have a decal or something directly on your 3DS, you can see it clearly. I personally bought this to protect the autographs I've collected on the front of my 3DS. I would definitely recommend this case!

Being a Grohe, I expected it to be better. In terms of build quality, it is short of being excellent as the switching of mode (between massage and rainshower) is not smooth and there are 4 clicks instead of 3 clicks (given that there are only 3 modes). As for water pressure, it is significantly reduced compared to the previous shower head.

This replaces an intex paper filter system that came with my above ground 12 x 24 saltwater pool.  This is a great replacement.  Easy to use and excellent suction.  Moves the water much better and is easy to clean.  Does a much better job of filtration. I have a connection directly to an underground drainage system and flush the filter into that.  Works great and I recommend it strongly.

It is hard to find well designed underwear with all that and the correct leg length, but these have it all! If you're a man... you need them and if you're a girlfriend that wants a sexy basic, you've found it buddies!

My own fault, didn't realize this watch came in two different sizes. I am a big girl & this watch dwarfed my wrist. Can't imagine how it would look on a petite chick. I gave it to my husband. He loves it. Just made it around his wrist. Now I have to decide if I want to go for smaller watch. Love the size of the numbers on the face, also like indiglow feature. Just really huge!

this is a product that can eliminate or greatly reduce severe pain in your body. just rub it on and if it is going to work for you, it will do so in under a minute.  for the most part it does just this. sometimes it fails to do so. the overall efficacy of this however is<br />great.

You can't see it from the photos, but this skirt is seamed from diagonal panels (godets). This, and the knitted material it is made from, make it drape very well.

I bought this phone because I got sick of all the fancy smart phones braking on me. I decided to go back to the basics. This thing is tough. It is practically unbreakable. I even dropped in water and it still works fine. My favorite thing about the item is the flashlight. I use it all the time and it is super bright. It is a basic phone that will live up to any challenge.

Beautiful but a bit too short for me, I am about 5'7&#34; and 144 @bs. Both ends of this wrap were cut at an angle, from one cornerwhich makes tying easier but it also makes the cloth loose.

Great system which accomplishes exactly what Bose sets out to accomplish! Provides amazing sound, great listening experience, and immerses you into whatever you are listening to.<br /><br />I do, however, believe that Bose is overpriced, but at the end of the day, it's worth it.

It wasn't even close in its construction, design and performance.  And, ya know what, buying local is a good idea but poorly trained humans can't begin to match the Amazon customer experience.  Life is changing, I guess.

Price and quality are good. I used some of the smaller ones a lot and they have no noticeable wear. Only gripe is that the handles on the small ones are tiny and it's tough to get any leverage with the small handle, which also cramps your hand a little after extended use.

The bag is as advertised--heavy-duty and spacious--and suits my needs perfectly. My only (minor) issue is that the bag arrived with some bumps/fraying on part of the front flap (perhaps an imperfection in the fabric itself?). Since the damage is purely cosmetic and fairly minute, I really don't mind, but if you're the sort of person who would, be aware that the bag may not arrive in immaculate condition.

Decent sound for the price. Not bad but not great either. Blue tooth connectivity is very weak though. If the device you are streaming the music from gets more than a few feet away the blue tooth signal will start cut out and get very choppy.

The biggest problem with these strips is that it that they will damage walls if improperly removed. I purchased these to put up some flat mirrors on the wall.

Did a lot of research before I bought this.  It's compact, has 2-sided scanning, color scanning, tray for documents (that folds up when not being used), feature that straightens scans and it is quick.  Software is top notch, you can save your scans to any location you chose.

Please note that you cannot do multi-color (think Christmas lights) but it does have seceral settings where it will fade from one color to the next<br /><br />Our guests love the effect this system brings to our dining room!

Terrible chair. It has only lasted 7 months before breaking. Any amount of leaning back (which I do occasionally to relax and think) will over time cause the chair to bend and eventually break. It's also quite uncomfortable. The backrest does not lineup well along my back, and the chair just feels too short, even though it's supposed to just be a task chair.

In the past I have not had great luck buying shoes from Amazon.  They often arrive looking different than advertised, but I was NOT disappointed with these.  Comfortable fit, durable, and I really like the waterproof feature.  (It is also great that they have the extra wide sizes.)  I ordered mine a half size larger because they only had 3E width, so the extra half size made-up the difference.

If you're an obsessive tester, like I was, these are great. They were able to pick up pregnancy hormone 3-days before my missed period, or about 11 DPO.

Good model. Last flag was a high quality pieced cotton flag too sturdy. For it's 3x5 size, there were too many days when she wouldn't fly. Proportions were wrong.

It is a must with the car caddy, the blur lighted M is not too bright and is pleasing. The cord is long enough to go from window to cigerttee lighter without being stretched.

I use these for paracord bracelets.  I tried using the 3/8 size since they were cheaper, but I came right back to these.  They work well and I haven't had a single one break on me yet.  They are easy to thread and I like that they are contoured- they fit better on your wrist than flat buckles

This is by far the best pouch i have ever owned. I am glad i was able to find it after it was no longer available from another manufacturer in this type of leather.

I hope this exact same product stays available for many years to come.

bought this for a sightseeing trip to NYC and was pretty disappointed. 90%+ of the pictures<br />were dull and had a washed out look. camera took a long time to process the shot before<br />allowing you to take another picture. moderate and low light autofocus is pretty poor.<br />720p videos turned out great.  very powerful flash, almost too powerful for indoors !<br /><br />i'll likely try the DSC-HX30 for my cruise next month.

As someone who has done a lot of reading and learning related to vaccines, I found this book to have some good info, but it was presented poorly. Many things are just brushed on the surface and not explained well enough and it seems to jump from one thought to another without connecting the dots. Not a good book for people looking to explore the "other side" of vaccination.

Interface was quite poor, moving between files was unpredictable, but took AAA batteries.<br /><br />We were a bit concerned about the battery not being removable, and having interface issues with this one also.  Not so.  Interface is just fine, and it charges when we put files on it so the battery life has not been an issue.

Our four year old can easy manipulate this seat and I love that I can take the entire thing off to clean... though I wish my husband would clean the toilets...!

Other than that, it seems like a good, solid watch chain, however.

This gig bag is a snug but doable fit for a Recording King OT-25 open back banjo.

This bed is very pretty.  My wife and I love it.  The only issue we had, is that the 3 support boards are not terribly supportive.  We ended up taking the boards off and setting the mattresses directly on the floor and now it's perfect.  So the 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the boards.

this works. It charges your battery but it is very fragile. Very. You have to give the safety of this chord way more attention than I am willing to spend. It basically needs a baby sitter to make sure that the part that plugs into the battery does't get damaged. I've had to buy 3 of these over the last 6 months because I have no choice. Not cool.

This fits a 2000 caviler perfectly. Is very simple to install and heavy steel. I expect it to last much longer than previous brackets that I have had professionally installed and I paid considerable less for this one. The hanger slides into place, and there is one excessively long bolt to close the clamp, but the bolt does not got in the way of anything, it just makes it easier to close the very strong clamp.

I can wear it comfortably with either suit and tie or jeans and t-shirt.  It is larger than any other watch I have owned and is as durable as it appears.  I hope to enjoy this watch for years to come.

I am 40-something just like Brooke and I found her video to be both challenging and do-able at the same time.  It's nice to be able to complete a workout video without having to stop because the moves are too complicated or I feel like I'm gonna die!  I still feel like I had a great workout and my sore body shows it the next day.

This allowed me to cut the (ethernet) cord and improve the bandwidth to my workstation. PCI based adapter is a much better solution than a 802.11ac USB dongle. Regularly see 700+ Mbps throughput in an environment I couldn't even get reliable wireless 802.11n connectivity. I only wish the external cabling to the magnetic mountable antenna array was longer than 3 feet. Great utilities as well. ASUS is rock solid hardware. I'm very happy with this purchase

Unlike other aftermarket cabin air filters, the TYC filter is just like OEM, well built, good solid feel to it. Other aftermarket brands that I have tried are flimsy and don't fit as well and usually cost more.

We have two compost containers, and last year I made the mistake of putting in stems of wisteria and dahlia stalks. They became hard in the compost pile, and they didn't want to break down into the lovely texture of compost. This was the answer. The stuff that comes out of this is like an old forest floor. I can't wait to spread it around in my garden this year.

this is an inexpensive telescoping flag pole.  They advertise 6' however I am 6'2&#34; and it comes up to my lips, so its closer to the 5'6&#34; range.

Wish it was a bit taller but again, it's a relatively inexpensive alternative to the $50 telescoping flag poles that you normally see.

AMAZING.  First: these pants arrived TWO days after I ordered them, FROM INDIA.  The material and designs are beautiful and high quality.  Yes, the pants could be tricky to tie at first -- these are wrap pants, just like wrap skirts.  However, it's not that hard, and if I can figure out an articulate way to explain it,  will update my review.

I used this kit to replace an inline Walbro 255LPH. I tried multiple different setups to get fuel to the pump but it was always having difficulties. I purchased this system after speaking with a tech at Aeromotive and it has cured all the problems I was having. I would recommend it to anyone as the install was very simple. I wish I had gone this route to begin with.

This lock is good to deter the grab and go thief. It's great for locking up my bike when i run into a store or pick up lunch. It does look easily pick-able, I accept that risk. Hopefully this lock is enough to have a opportunist thief look elsewhere. As others wrote, it's not big enough to lock wheel, frame to a rail, it's a specific purpose lock. Key turns smoothly.

Very well made stove and is very easy to operate. The autoignition worked quickly every time.

I find this product runs on the sticky side, especially when it dries, which is less than desirable.

Very beautiful stickers and design; however, it's not as big as the pictures indicate or maybe their room is smaller than the norm. They were packaged very nicely and easy to apply to the surface.

I really like these earrings because they are a great length (not too long but enough to stand out) and very lightweight.  I get lots of compliments on them.  My only complaint is they get tangled easily when not in use, in fact they arrived tangled.  So I just store them carefully and it seems to have solved the problem.

Very Pretty, Just like the picture. I have this and the one similar in gold. The gold stands out a bit better. But this is just as pretty. The ring is elastic, which I don't really care for but it makes for a better fit. This would be nicer if the beads for sliver stone. But its a very nice classy look.

I have bought many sony products and over time the quality has declined into the junk status. From first setup to final moments a span of just 5 months the Blu-Ray player locked up, froze, disconnected from the internet, paused, and spontaneously rebooted. In the end the player connected to the internet but would not connect to any of the services. I will never buy a Sony product again.

Waist strap goes around your stomach and I had to redo some of the stitching that was coming apart.

Naughty Dog (makers of the Uncharted series) has hit another one out of the park. I've been playing this for a few days now and I can't stop. It takes some getting used to because it's not your typical shoot 'em up first person action game, but stick with it.

This is a nice bag! It has plenty of pockets for all my business travel needs, although it doesn't have any small zipper pockets for loose items. This was easily remedied with a small stylish change purse. The tag on the inside says Kenneth Cole, however everything else says Heritage. This would easily be a $300-400 Kenneth Cole bag. Score!

I bought this ring because my husband lost his original wedding band.  It looks really nice at first, but after a few months the silver shine turned black and dull.

Absolutely terrible phone, you have to change settings to prevent it from boot-looping (where it frustratingly just keeps shutting down on it's own). It crashes endlessly, it crashes if it gets hot, cold, turned upside down. Just don't buy it, it's not worth it EVEN FREE.

I tested vs another cable by a different manufacturer to make sure it was the cable and confirmed.  This cable produces visible ghosting.  You can see it most easily with vertical lines in high contrast color areas.  To the right of the line you'll see pink and green ghosting.<br /><br />It's not totally horrible, but it is somewhat distracting so I'm going to send it back for a replacement that doesn't have ghosting.

I bought this 3D TV in 2012.  The picture is still perfect and the 3D is amazing.  Because it uses passive imagery, the 3D glasses cause no headaches or eye strain.  The only problem is that fewer and fewer movies are being released on Blu-Ray in 3D, but those few are fantastic on this TV.  If this LD TV ever stops working, I would definitely replace with another LG 3D TV.

It came wrapped up in the cutest little bag and wrapped in hairnets. Fits great on my head which can be adjusted by straps in the back. The clip on pony tails are really easy to use and the whole wig looks great. It's amazingly soft and came with instructions to keep it that way. Overall a five star wig.

The minute I stepped into these, I knew I would love them!  They feel different than any shoe I have ever worn.  Love how they look with white straight leg jeans.  They look great with bermuda shorts also.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone!  So many varieties of patterns also so any age could wear these.  MUST TRY!!!

These pants fit great.  I have trouble with my weight being around my waist so an 8 is usually too big every where but barely buttons.  These pants have good stretch so fit through the thighs and sit nicely at my waist.  I still have to pull them up occasionally but don't sag down to where my rear end shows!  Very comfortable and look more like slacks than jeans.

I believe these run small. I tried one on at Macy's so I knew to order a medium rather than a small. I am 5'1&#34; 105 lbs and 32A for reference. The medium fits perfectly. The bra is SO cute. I purchased in grey as well.

I have worn the 180s brand for quite awhile, so I bought these to replace  an old pair. Unfortunately for me,  the polyester outer shell rubs against my scarf or coat and makes a lot of noise.

I ordered a size 5, which was way to big, so I returned the size 5 and brought a size 4, which is still somewhat big. I have to put inside support to make them work (which I hate doing).<br />I haven't worn them yet, so I do not know if they will be comfortable. But for 69.00 they should of fit perfectly....<br />Very disappointed

Ray bans are good quality. I have never had problems with their glasses and this time is no different.<br /><br />I like that this style doesn't have such a thick frame all the way around the lens.<br /><br />They are extremely comfortable and most importantly keep the sun out of your eyes.<br /><br />The price is very reasonable considering the quality of glasses you are getting.

I usually love Nine West bags, but this one just isn't doing it for me. While there are two side pockets on the inside of the bag, they are barely big enough to hold anything.  AND if you have a slightly thicker wallet in the middle compartment, the magnetic tab at the top will not stay closed.

This is a very pretty shirt.  The lace is pretty, not too stiff, but not delicate.  The style is very flattering.  I purchased this to have a dressy shirt for the holidays.  I ordered an XXL  based on the sizing chart.  Normally I am an XL.  The XXL fits snugly.

I had a pair of Spiras before replacing it with this pair and the new pair sized out to large but wearable. It's a great looking pair &#34;Air Force&#34; colors that I love. My feet tend to slide on cushion and they make my ankle feel like I'm going to twist it.  It's not stable like my old pair.

These are literally my second favorite shoes. (Second only to my Nike flip-flops!). They are so comfy. I have noticed a little bunching, getting a little slouchy around the ankles, but I think that may be because of my larger than average calves and regular ankles. BY the way, the normal size fits my muscular calves quite well. I wear a size 10 and size 10 fits perfectly. Would definitely buy Dr. Scholl's boots again.

Got these just in time to hike on snow-covered gravel road. They were warm and had great traction. Best of all, they are quick and easy to lace up- just wind them around the hooks and off you go.
